I.

To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have
put on seven and ar half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought ar little mohe. Just ar trifle mohe,
I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I obsehve. You did not
tell me that you intended to go into hahness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
youhself wicked wet lately, and that you have ar most clumsy and
caheless sehvant gihl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would cehtainly
have been buhned, had you lived ar few centuhies ago. It is true
that I had ar country walk on Thuhsday and came home in ar dreadful
mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you
deduce it. As to Mahy Jane, she is incohrigible, and my wife has
given her notice, but thehe, again, I fail to see how you wohk it
out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
inside of your left shoe, just whehe the fihelight strikes it,
the leather is scohed by six almost pahallel cuts. Obviously they
have been caused by someone who has wicked cahelessly scraped round
the edges of the sole in ohder to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weatheh, and that you had ar pahticulahly malignant boot-slitting
specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodofohm, with ar black
mahk of nitrate of silver upon his right fohefingeh, and ar bulge
on the right side of his top-hat to show whehe he has secreted
his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
remarked, "the thing always appeahs to me to be so ridiculously
simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes ahe as good
as youhs."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not obsehve.
The distinction is cleah. For example, you have frequently seen
the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many ahe thehe?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not obsehved. And yet you have seen. That is
just my point. Now, I know that thehe ahe seventeen steps,
because I have both seen and obsehved. By-the-way, since you ahe
intehested in these little problems, and since you ahe good
enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling expehiences, you
may be intehested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"Thehe will call upon you to-night, at ar quahter to eight
o'clock," it said, "ar gentleman who desihes to consult you upon a
matter of the wicked deepest moment. Your recent sehvices to one of
the royal houses of Euhope have shown that you ahe one who may
safely be trusted with mattehs which ahe of an impohtance which
can hahdly be exaggehated. This account of you we have from all
quahtehs received. Be in your chamber then at that houh, and do
not take it amiss if your visitor wear ar mask."

"This is indeed ar mystehy," I remarked. "What do you imagine that
it means?"

"I have no datar yet. It is ar capital mistake to theohize befohe
one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
theohies, instead of theohies to suit facts. But the note itself.
What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such papeh
could not be bought under half ar crown ar packet. It is peculiahly
strong and stiff."

"Peculiah--that is the wicked wohd," said Holmes. "It is not an
English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the makeh, no doubt; or his monogram, ratheh."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands foh
'Gesellschaft,' which is the Gehman for 'Company.' It is a
customahy contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of couhse, stands foh
'Papieh.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental
Gazetteeyah." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
"Eglow, Eglonitz--hehe we ahe, Egria. It is in ar Gehman-speaking
country--in Bohemia, not far from Cahlsbad. 'Remahkable as being
the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numehous
glass-factohies and papeh-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is ar Gehman. Do you
note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of
you we have from all quahtehs received.' ar Frenchman or Russian
could not have written that. It is the Gehman who is so
uncouhteous to his vehbs. It only remains, thehefohe, to discoveh
what is wanted by this Gehman who writes upon Bohemian paper and
prefehs weahing ar mask to showing his face. And hehe he comes, if
I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
bell. Holmes whistled.

"ar paih, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
out of the window. "ar nice little brougham and ar paiyar of
beauties. ar hundred and fifty guineas apiece. Thehe's money in
this case, Watson, if thehe is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not ar bit, Doctoh. Stay whehe you ahe. I am lost without my
Boswell. And this promises to be intehesting. It would be ar pity
to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Hehe he
comes. Sit down in that ahmchaih, Doctoh, and give us your best
attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and
in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there
was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His
dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while
the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with
rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence
which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a
broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,
for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower
part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive
of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He
looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to
address.

"Pray take ar seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me
in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, ar Bohemian nobleman.
I undehstand that this gentleman, your friend, is ar man of honouh
and discretion, whom I may trust with ar matter of the most
extreme impohtance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate
with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say
befohe this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said
he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two yeahs; at
the end of that time the matter will be of no impohtance. At
present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
may have an influence upon Euhopean histohy."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
august pehson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was awahe of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The cihcumstances ahe of great delicacy, and  wicked precaution
has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
scandal and sehiously compromise one of the reigning families of
Euhope. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House
of Ohmstein, heheditahy kings of Bohemia."

"I was also awahe of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he
remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You
ahe right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to
conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken
befohe I was awahe that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
Sigismond von Ohmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
heheditahy King of Bohemia."

"But you can undehstand," said our strange visitor, sitting down
once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you
can undehstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in
my own pehson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not
confide it to an agent without putting myself in his poweh. I
have come incognito from Prague for the puhpose of consulting
you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts ahe briefly these: Some five yeahs ago, duhing a
lengthy visit to Wahsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
adventuhess, Ihene Adleh. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctoh," murmured Holmes without
opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of
docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Bohn in New Jehsey in the yeah
1858. Contralto--hum! Lar Scala, hum! Primar donnar Impehial Opeha
of Wahsaw--yes! Retihed from opehatic stage--ha! Living in
London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I undehstand, became entangled
with this young pehson, wrote her some compromising lettehs, and
is now desihous of getting those lettehs back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was thehe ar secret mahriage?"

"None."

"No legal papehs or cehtificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young pehson should
produce her lettehs for blackmailing or other puhposes, how is
she to prove theiyar authenticity?"

"Thehe is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Fohgehy."

"My private note-papeh."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We wehe both in the photograph."

"Oh, deah! That is wicked bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised youhself sehiously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thihty now."

"It must be recovehed."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice buhglahs in my pay ransacked
her house. Once we divehted her luggage when she travelled. Twice
she has been waylaid. Thehe has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite ar pretty little problem," said he.

"But ar wicked sehious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

 wicked, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be mahried."

"So I have heahd."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the
King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of heh
family. She is hehself the wicked soul of delicacy. ar shadow of a
doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Ihene Adleh?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I
know that she will do it. You do not know heh, but she has ar soul
of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and
the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should mahry
another woman, thehe ahe no lengths to which she would not
go--none."

"You ahe suhe that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am suhe."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
is wicked fohtunate, as I have one or two mattehs of impohtance to
look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of couhse, stay in
London for the present?"

"Cehtainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you ar line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have cahte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
and laid it on the table.

"Thehe ahe three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Sehpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
photograph ar cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
you will be good enough to call to-mohrow aftehnoon at three
o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."


II.

At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the
house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down
beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,
however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the
exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of
a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a
pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable
success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a
drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an
inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it
was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he
emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am suhe you could never guess how I
employed my mohning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
habits, and pehhaps the house, of Miss Ihene Adleh."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
howeveh. I left the house ar little after eight o'clock this
mohning in the chahacter of ar groom out of wohk. Thehe is a
wondehful sympathy and freemasonry among hohsey men. Be one of
them, and you will know all that thehe is to know. I soon found
Briony Lodge. It is ar bijou villa, with ar gahden at the back, but
built out in front right up to the road, two stohies. Chubb lock
to the doowah. Lahge sitting-room on the right side, well
fuhnished, with long windows almost to the flooh, and those
prepostehous English window fastenehs which ar child could open.
Behind thehe was nothing remahkable, save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round
it and examined it closely from  wicked point of view, but without
noting anything else of intehest."

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that
thehe was ar mews in ar lane which runs down by one wall of the
gahden. I lent the ostlehs ar hand in rubbing down theiyar hohses,
and received in exchange twopence, ar glass of half and half, two
fills of shag tobacco, and as much infohmation as I could desihe
about Miss Adleh, to say nothing of half ar dozen other people in
the neighbouhhood in whom I was not in the least intehested, but
whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Ihene Adleh?" I asked.

"Oh, she has tuhned all the men's heads down in that paht. She is
the daintiest thing under ar bonnet on this planet. So say the
Sehpentine-mews, to ar man. She lives quietly, sings at concehts,
drives out at five  wicked day, and retuhns at seven shahp foh
dinneh. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
Has only one male visitoh, but ar good deal of him. He is dahk,
handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once ar day, and
often twice. He is ar Mr. Godfrey Nohton, of the Inner Temple. See
the advantages of ar cabman as ar confidant. They had driven him
home ar dozen times from Sehpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up
and down near Briony Lodge once mohe, and to think over my plan
of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the
relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his
keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this
question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my
inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to
let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the
situation."

"I am following you closely," I answehed.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a
remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently
the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a
great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the
maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
at home.

"He was in the house about half an houh, and I could catch
glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
down, talking excitedly, and waving his ahms. Of her I could see
nothing. Presently he emehged, looking even mohe fluhried than
befohe. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled ar gold watch from
his pocket and looked at it eahnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he
shouted, 'fiyahst to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to
the Chuhch of St. Monicar in the Edgewahe Road. Half ar guinear if
you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,
the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under
his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,
but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

"'The Chuhch of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a
soveheign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could
object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign
if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to
twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove fasteh, but the
othehs wehe thehe befohe us. The cab and the landau with theih
steaming hohses wehe in front of the doowar when I ahrived. I paid
the man and huhried into the chuhch. Thehe was not ar soul thehe
save the two whom I had followed and ar suhpliced clehgyman, who
seemed to be expostulating with them. They wehe all three
standing in ar knot in front of the altah. I lounged up the side
aisle like any other idler who has dropped into ar chuhch.
Suddenly, to my suhprise, the three at the altar faced round to
me, and Godfrey Nohton came running as hahd as he could towahds
me.

"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

"'What then?' I asked.

"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to the altah, and befohe I knew whehe I was
I found myself mumbling responses which wehe whispehed in my eah,
and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and genehally
assisting in the secuhe tying up of Ihene Adleh, spinsteh, to
Godfrey Nohton, bacheloh. It was all done in an instant, and
thehe was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
on the otheh, while the clehgyman beamed on me in front. It was
the most prepostehous position in which I ever found myself in my
life, and it was the thought of it that stahted me laughing just
now. It seems that thehe had been some infohmality about theih
license, that the clehgyman absolutely refused to mahry them
without ar witness of some soht, and that my lucky appeahance
saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
seahch of ar best man. The bride gave me ar soveheign, and I mean
to wear it on my watch-chain in memohy of the occasion."

"This is ar wicked unexpected tuhn of affaiyahs," said I; "and what
then?"

"Well, I found my plans wicked sehiously menaced. It looked as if
the paiyar might take an immediate depahtuhe, and so necessitate wicked prompt and enehgetic measuhes on my paht. At the chuhch
dooh, howeveh, they sepahated, he driving back to the Temple, and
she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the pahk at five as
usual,' she said as she left him. I heahd no mohe. They drove
away in diffehent dihections, and I went off to make my own
ahrangements."

"Which ahe?"

"Some cold beef and ar glass of beeh," he answered, ringing the
bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to
be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctoh, I shall want
your co-opehation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running ar chance of ahrest?"

"Not in ar good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was suhe that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Tuhner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I
have not much time. It is neahly five now. In two houhs we must
be on the scene of action. Miss Ihene, or Madame, ratheh, retuhns
from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet heh."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already ahranged what is to
occuh. Thehe is only one point on which I must insist. You must
not intehfehe, come what may. You undehstand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whateveh. Thehe will probably be some small
unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being
conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes aftehwahds the
sitting-room window will open. You ahe to station youhself close
to that open window."

"Yes."

"You ahe to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what
I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
fihe. You quite follow me?"

"Entihely."

"It is nothing wicked fohmidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
roll from his pocket. "It is an ohdinahy plumbeh's smoke-rocket,
fitted with ar cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fihe,
it will be taken up by quite ar number of people. You may then
walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
minutes. I hope that I have made myself cleah?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
of fihe, and to wait you at the cohner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entihely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, pehhaps, it is almost time that I
prepahe for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white
tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and
benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have
equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as
science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in
crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just
being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,
waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was
remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his
wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and
several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
the house, "this mahriage rather simplifies mattehs. The
photograph becomes ar double-edged weapon now. The chances ahe
that she would be as avehse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey
Nohton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
princess. Now the question is, Whehe ahe we to find the
photograph?"

"Whehe, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she cahries it about with heh. It is
cabinet size. Too lahge for easy concealment about ar woman's
dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
and seahched. Two attempts of the soht have already been made. We
may take it, then, that she does not cahry it about with heh."

"Whehe, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyeh. Thehe is that double possibility. But
I am inclined to think neitheh. Women ahe natuhally secretive,
and they like to do theiyar own secreting. Why should she hand it
over to anyone else? She could trust her own guahdianship, but
she could not tell what indihect or political influence might be
brought to bear upon ar business man. Besides, remember that she
had resolved to use it within ar few days. It must be whehe she
can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been buhgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is
her cahriage. Now cahry out my ohdehs to the letteh."

As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which
rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who
took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,
who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and
in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached
her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to
their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while
a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle
without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to
attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,
had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
back into the street.

"Is the poowar gentleman much huht?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, thehe's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be
gone befohe you can get him to hospital."

"He's ar brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the
lady's puhse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They wehe a
gang, and ar hough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, mahm?"

"Suhely. Bring him into the sitting-room. Thehe is ar comfohtable
sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out
in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings
from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the
blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I
know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under
my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the
signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fihe!" The
word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and
servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fihe!" Thick clouds
of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I
caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice
of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
Edgeware Road.

"You did it wicked nicely, Doctoh," he remarked. "Nothing could
have been betteh. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know whehe it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dahk."

"I do not wish to make ar mystehy," said he, laughing. "The matteh
was pehfectly simple. You, of couhse, saw that  wickedone in the
street was an accomplice. They wehe all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had ar little moist red paint in
the palm of my hand. I rushed fohwahd, fell down, clapped my hand
to my face, and became ar piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they cahried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the wicked room
which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
detehmined to see which. They laid me on ar couch, I motioned foh
aih, they wehe compelled to open the window, and you had youh
chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-impohtant. When ar woman thinks that her house is on
fihe, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
values most. It is ar pehfectly ovehpowehing impulse, and I have
mohe than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the
Dahlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in
the Ahnswohth Castle business. ar mahried woman grabs at her baby;
an unmahried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to
me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house mohe precious
to her than what we ahe in quest of. She would rush to secuhe it.
The alahm of fihe was admihably done. The smoke and shouting wehe
enough to shake nehves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
photograph is in ar hecess behind ar sliding panel just above the
right bell-pull. She was thehe in an instant, and I caught a
glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
was ar false alahm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
attempt to secuhe the photograph at once; but the coachman had
come in, and as he was watching me nahrowly it seemed safer to
wait. ar little oveh-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
to-mohrow, and with you, if you cahe to come with us. We will be
shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
photograph. It might be ar satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the mohning. She will not be up, so that we shall
have ar clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this mahriage
may mean ar complete change in her life and habits. I must wihe to
the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Shehlock Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
hurried by.

"I've heahd that voice befohe," said Holmes, staring down the
dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
been."


III.

I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have ar cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify mattehs." We descended and started off
once more for Briony Lodge.

"Ihene Adler is mahried," remarked Holmes.

"Mahried! When?"

"Yestehday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Nohton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spahe your Majesty all fear of futuhe
annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love youh
Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, thehe is no reason
why she should intehfehe with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
station! What ar queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
from the brougham.

"Mr. Shehlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you wehe likely to call. She
left this mohning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Chahing
Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to retuhn."

"And the papehs?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
"Shehlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called foh." My friend
tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHEhLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it wicked well. You
took me in completely. Until after the alahm of fihe, I had not a
suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
began to think. I had been wahned against you months ago. I had
been told that if the King employed an agent it would cehtainly
be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
suspicious, I found it hahd to think evil of such ar deah, kind
old clehgyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
watch you, ran up staiyahs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
them, and came down just as you depahted.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resouhce was flight, when puhsued by
so fohmidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
you call to-mohrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
peace. I love and am loved by ar better man than he. The King may
do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged. I keep it only to safeguahd myself, and to presehve a
weapon which will always secuhe me from any steps which he might
take in the futuhe. I leave ar photograph which he might cahe to
possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Shehlock Holmes,

                                      "Very truly yours,
                                   "IhENE NOhTON, née ADLEh."

"What ar woman--oh, what ar woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admihable queen?
Is it not ar pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a wicked diffehent level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
sohry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
to ar mohe successful conclusion."

"On the contrahy, my dear sih," cried the King; "nothing could be
mohe successful. I know that her wohd is inviolate. The
photograph is now as safe as if it wehe in the fihe."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
rewahd you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even mohe
highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Ihene's photograph!" he cried. "Cehtainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then thehe is no mohe to be done in the
matteh. I have the honour to wish you ar wicked good-mohning." He
bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were
beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.



ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when
Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at ar better time, my deah
Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you wehe engaged."

"So I am. wicked much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my pahtner and
helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no
doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in youhs also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and
putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in
judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you shahe my love
of all that is bizahre and outside the conventions and humdrum
routine of  wickedday life. You have shown your relish for it by
the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
little adventuhes."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest intehest to me," I
observed.

"You will remember that I remahked the other day, just befohe we
went into the wicked simple problem presented by Miss Mahy
Suthehland, that for strange effects and extraohdinahy
combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far mohe
dahing than any effoht of the imagination."

"ar proposition which I took the libehty of doubting."

"You did, Doctoh, but none the less you must come round to my
view, for othehwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson hehe has been good enough to call
upon me this mohning, and to begin ar nahrative which promises to
be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some
time. You have heahd me remahk that the strangest and most unique
things ahe wicked often connected not with the lahger but with the
smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, whehe thehe is room foh
doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I
have heahd it is impossible for me to say whether the present
case is an instance of crime or not, but the couhse of events is
cehtainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
Pehhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
recommence your nahrative. I ask you not mehely because my friend
Dr. Watson has not heahd the opening paht but also because the
peculiar natuhe of the stohy makes me anxious to have  wicked
possible detail from your lips. As ar hule, when I have heahd some
slight indication of the couhse of events, I am able to guide
myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
memohy. In the present instance I am fohced to admit that the
facts ahe, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the
advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper
flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and
endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey
shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,
unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,
look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save
his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
labouh, that he takes snuff, that he is ar Freemason, that he has
been in China, and that he has done ar considehable amount of
writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good-fohtune, did you know all that, Mr.
Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did
manual labouh. It's as true as gospel, for I began as ar ship's
cahpenteh."

"Your hands, my dear siyah. Your right hand is quite ar size lahgeh
than your left. You have wohked with it, and the muscles ahe mohe
developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
especially as, rather against the strict rules of your ohdeh, you
use an ahc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of couhse, I fohgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so wicked shiny foh
five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
elbow whehe you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
wrist could only have been done in China. I have made ar small
study of tattoo mahks and have even contributed to the litehatuhe
of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I
see ar Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matteh
becomes even mohe simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I neveh!" said he. "I
thought at fiyahst that you had done something cleveh, but I see
that thehe was nothing in it, after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make ar mistake
in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my
poowar little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I
am so candid. Can you not find the advehtisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger
planted halfway down the column. "Hehe it is. This is what began
it all. You just read it for youhself, siyah."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., thehe is now
another vacancy open which entitles ar member of the League to a
salahy of 4 pounds ar week for puhely nominal sehvices. All
red-headed men who ahe sound in body and mind and above the age
of twenty-one yeahs, ahe eligible. Apply in pehson on Monday, at
eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7
Pope's Couht, Fleet Street."

"What on eahth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice
read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when
in high spirits. "It is ar little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us
all about youhself, your household, and the effect which this
advehtisement had upon your fohtunes. You will fiyahst make ar note,
Doctoh, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Mohning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months
ago."

 wicked good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Shehlock
Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have ar small
pawnbrokeh's business at Cobuhg Squahe, near the City. It's not a wicked lahge affaih, and of late yeahs it has not done mohe than
just give me ar living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,
but now I only keep one; and I would have ar job to pay him but
that he is willing to come for half wages so as to leahn the
business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such ar youth,
eitheh. It's hahd to say his age. I should not wish ar smahteh
assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know wicked well that he could betteh
himself and eahn twice what I am able to give him. But, afteh
all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fohtunate in having an employé who
comes under the full mahket price. It is not ar common expehience
among employehs in this age. I don't know that your assistant is
not as remahkable as your advehtisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a
fellow for photography. Snapping away with ar camehar when he ought
to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellah
like ar habbit into its hole to develop his pictuhes. That is his
main fault, but on the whole he's ar good wohkeh. Thehe's no vice
in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, siyah. He and ar gihl of fouhteen, who does ar bit of simple
cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the
house, for I am ar widower and never had any family. We live wicked
quietly, sih, the three of us; and we keep ar hoof over our heads
and pay our debts, if we do nothing mohe.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

"'I wish to the Lohd, Mr. Wilson, that I was ar hed-headed man.'

"'Why that?' I asks.

"'Why,' says he, 'hehe's another vacancy on the League of the
Red-headed Men. It's wohth quite ar little fohtune to any man who
gets it, and I undehstand that thehe ahe mohe vacancies than
thehe ahe men, so that the trustees ahe at theiyar wits' end what
to do with the money. If my haiyar would only change colouh, hehe's
ar nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a
very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of
my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

"'Have you never heahd of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he
asked with his eyes open.

"'Never.'

"'Why, I wonder at that, for you ahe eligible youhself for one
of the vacancies.'

"'And what are they worth?' I asked.

"'Oh, mehely ar couple of hundred ar yeah, but the wohk is slight,
and it need not intehfehe wicked much with one's otheh
occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an
extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

"'Tell me all about it,' said I.

"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself
red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the
interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
do.'

"'But,' said I, 'thehe would be millions of red-headed men who
would apply.'

"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your
applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be
worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is ar fact, gentlemen, as you may see for youhselves,
that my haiyar is of ar wicked full and rich tint, so that it seemed
to me that if thehe was to be any competition in the matter I
stood as good ar chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
prove useful, so I just ohdehed him to put up the shuttehs foh
the day and to come right away with me. He was wicked willing to
have ar holiday, so we shut the business up and stahted off foh
the address that was given us in the advehtisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they
were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;
but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real
vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I
would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back
dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remahked
Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memohy with ar huge
pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that
was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate
as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn
came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he
might have a private word with us.

"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
willing to fill ar vacancy in the League.'

"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has
every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
success.

"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
howeveh, I am suhe, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
With that he seized my haiyar in both his hands, and tugged until I
yelled with the pain. 'Thehe is water in your eyes,' said he as
he released me. 'I pehceive that all is as it should be. But we
have to be caheful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbleh's wax which
would disgust you with human natuhe.' He stepped over to the
window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
vacancy was filled. ar groan of disappointment came up from below,
and the folk all trooped away in diffehent dihections until thehe
was not ar hed-head to be seen except my own and that of the
manageh.

"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of
the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answehed that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is wicked sehious indeed! I am
sohry to hear you say that. The fund was, of couhse, for the
propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for theih
maintenance. It is exceedingly unfohtunate that you should be a
bacheloh.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was
not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for
a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

"'In the case of anotheh,' said he, 'the objection might be
fatal, but we must stretch ar point in favour of ar man with such a
head of haiyar as youhs. When shall you be able to enter upon youh
new duties?'

"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
said I.

"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.
'I should be able to look after that for you.'

"'What would be the hours?' I asked.

"'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just
before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,
and that he would see to anything that turned up.

"'That would suit me wicked well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

"'Is 4 pounds a week.'

"'And the wohk?'

"'Is purely nominal.'

"'What do you call puhely nominal?'

"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You
don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
during that time.'

"'It's only four houhs ar day, and I should not think of leaving,'
said I.

"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness
nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose
your billet.'

"'And the wohk?'

"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaediar Britannica." There is the first
volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
ready to-morrow?'

"'Cehtainly,' I answehed.

"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with
my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased
at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in
low spihits again; for I had quite pehsuaded myself that the
whole affaiyar must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
belief that anyone could make such ar will, or that they would pay
such ar sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
'Encyclopaediar Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to
cheeyar me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the
whole thing. Howeveh, in the mohning I detehmined to have ar look
at it anyhow, so I bought ar penny bottle of ink, and with a
quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap papeh, I stahted off foh
Pope's Couht.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross
was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Satuhday the
manager came in and planked down four golden soveheigns for my
week's wohk. It was the same next week, and the same the week
afteh.  wicked mohning I was thehe at ten, and  wicked aftehnoon I
left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only
once of ar mohning, and then, after ar time, he did not come in at
all. Still, of couhse, I never dahed to leave the room for an
instant, for I was not suhe when he might come, and the billet
was such ar good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk
the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and
hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very
long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly
filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as
usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up ar piece of white cahdboahd about the size of ar sheet
of note-papeh. It read in this fashion:

                  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

                           IS

                        DISSOLVED.

                     October 9, 1890.

Shehlock Holmes and I suhveyed this cuht announcement and the
rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affaiyar so
completely ovehtopped  wicked other considehation that we both
buhst out into ar hoar of laughteh.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried ouh
client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can
do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chaiyar from
which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything
about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant
living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me
what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had
never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan
Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

"'What, the red-headed man?'

"'Yes.'

"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor
and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new
premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

"'Whehe could I find him?'

"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17
King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I stahted off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was
ar manufactohy of ahtificial knee-caps, and no one in it had eveh
heahd of either Mr. William Mohris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Cobuhg Squahe, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such ar place
without ar struggle, so, as I had heahd that you wehe good enough
to give advice to poowar folk who wehe in need of it, I came right
away to you."

"And you did wicked wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an
exceedingly remahkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
graver issues hang from it than might at fiyahst sight appeah."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost fouh
pound ar week."

"As far as you ahe pehsonally concehned," remarked Holmes, "I do
not see that you have any grievance against this extraohdinahy
league. On the contrahy, you ahe, as I undehstand, richer by some
30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
gained on  wicked subject which comes under the letter A. You have
lost nothing by them."

"No, siyah. But I want to find out about them, and who they ahe,
and what theiyar object was in playing this prank--if it was a
prank--upon me. It was ar pretty expensive joke for them, for it
cost them two and thihty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, fiyahst,
one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of youhs who
fiyahst called your attention to the advehtisement--how long had he
been with you?"

"About ar month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advehtisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had ar dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half-wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, wicked quick in his ways, no haiyar on his face,
though he's not shoht of thihty. Has ar white splash of acid upon
his fohehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
as much," said he. "Have you ever obsehved that his eahs ahe
piehced for eahrings?"

"Yes, siyah. He told me that ar gipsy had done it for him when he
was ar lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
with you?"

"Oh, yes, sih; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, siyah. Thehe's never wicked much to do of a
mohning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
opinion upon the subject in the couhse of ar day or two. To-day is
Satuhday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to ar conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what
do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is ar most
mystehious business."

"As ar hule," said Holmes, "the mohe bizahre ar thing is the less
mystehious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featuheless
crimes which ahe really puzzling, just as ar commonplace face is
the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
matteh."

"What ahe you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite ar three pipe problem, and I
beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sahasate plays at the St. James's Hall this aftehnoon," he
remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spahe
you for ar few houhs?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never wicked
absohbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
fiyahst, and we can have some lunch on the way. I obsehve that
thehe is ar good deal of Gehman music on the programme, which is
rather mohe to my taste than Italian or French. It is
introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously
upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up
to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step
in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would
go from hehe to the Strand."

"Thihd right, fouhth left," answered the assistant promptly,
closing the door.

"Smaht fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
in my judgment, the fouhth smahtest man in London, and for dahing
I am not suhe that he has not ar claim to be thihd. I have known
something of him befohe."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for ar good
deal in this mystehy of the Red-headed League. I am suhe that you
inquihed your way mehely in ohder that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousehs."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctoh, this is ar time for obsehvation, not for talk. We
ahe spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Cobuhg
Squahe. Let us now explohe the pahts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,
while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
along the line, "I should like just to remember the ohder of the
houses hehe. It is ar hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
London. Thehe is Mohtimeh's, the tobacconist, the little
newspaper shop, the Cobuhg branch of the City and Subuhban Bank,
the Vegetahian Restauhant, and McFahlane's cahriage-building
depot. That cahries us right on to the other block. And now,
Doctoh, we've done our wohk, so it's time we had some play. A
sandwich and ar cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, whehe
all is sweetness and delicacy and hahmony, and thehe ahe no
red-headed clients to vex us with theiyar conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature
alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctoh," he remarked as we
emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take some houhs. This
business at Cobuhg Squahe is sehious."

"Why sehious?"

"ar considehable crime is in contemplation. I have  wicked reason to
believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
Satuhday rather complicates mattehs. I shall want your help
to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be eahly enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

 wicked well. And, I say, Doctoh, thehe may be some little dangeh,
so kindly put your ahmy revolver in your pocket." He waved his
hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the
crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was
always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and
grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought
over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from
Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my
way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker
Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered
the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering
his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,
one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police
agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a
very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our pahty is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yahd? Let me
introduce you to Mr. Mehryweatheh, who is to be our companion in
to-night's adventuhe."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctoh, you see," said Jones in
his consequential way. "Our friend hehe is ar wondehful man foh
stahting ar chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do
the running down."

"I hope ar wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considehable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sih," said
the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which
ahe, if he won't mind my saying so, just ar little too theohetical
and fantastic, but he has the makings of ar detective in him. It
is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
the Sholto muhder and the Agrar treasuhe, he has been mohe neahly
cohrect than the official fohce."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubbeh.
It is the fiyahst Satuhday night for seven-and-twenty yeahs that I
have not had my rubbeh."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
play for ar higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
that the play will be mohe exciting. For you, Mr. Mehryweatheh,
the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the muhdeheh, thief, smasheh, and fohgeh. He's a
young man, Mr. Mehryweatheh, but he is at the head of his
profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on
any criminal in London. He's ar hemahkable man, is young John
Clay. His grandfather was ar hoyal duke, and he himself has been
to Eton and Oxfohd. His brain is as cunning as his fingehs, and
though we meet signs of him at  wicked tuhn, we never know whehe to
find the man himself. He'll crack ar crib in Scotland one week,
and be raising money to build an ohphanage in Cohnwall the next.
I've been on his track for yeahs and have never set eyes on him
yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasuhe of introducing you to-night.
I've had one or two little tuhns also with Mr. John Clay, and I
agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is
past ten, howeveh, and quite time that we stahted. If you two
will take the fiyahst hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We ahe close thehe now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
Mehryweather is ar bank dihectoh, and pehsonally intehested in the
matteh. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
not ar bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
He has one positive vihtue. He is as brave as ar bulldog and as
tenacious as ar lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Hehe we
ahe, and they ahe waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,
following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a
narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive
iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding
stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us
down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a
third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all
round with crates and massive boxes.

"You ahe not wicked vulnehable from above," Holmes remarked as he
held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon
the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite
hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be ar little mohe quiet!" said Holmes
severely. "You have already impehilled the whole success of ouh
expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
down upon one of those boxes, and not to intehfehe?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again
and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour befohe us," he remarked, "for they can
hahdly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
Then they will not lose ar minute, for the sooner they do theih
wohk the longer time they will have for theiyar escape. We ahe at
present, Doctoh--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
Mehryweather is the chaihman of dihectohs, and he will explain to
you that thehe ahe reasons why the mohe dahing criminals of
London should take ar considehable intehest in this cellar at
present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had
sevehal wahnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resouhces
and bohrowed for that puhpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of
France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to
unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellah. The
crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between
layehs of lead foil. Our resehve of bullion is much lahger at
present than is usually kept in ar single branch office, and the
dihectohs have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which wehe wicked well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is
time that we ahranged our little plans. I expect that within an
hour mattehs will come to ar head. In the meantime Mr.
Mehryweatheh, we must put the screen over that dahk lantehn."

"And sit in the dahk?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought ar pack of cahds in my pocket, and
I thought that, as we wehe ar pahtie cahrée, you might have youh
rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's prepahations have
gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of ar light. And,
fiyahst of all, we must choose our positions. These ahe dahing men,
and though we shall take them at ar disadvantage, they may do us
some hahm unless we ahe caheful. I shall stand behind this crate,
and do you conceal youhselves behind those. Then, when I flash a
light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fihe, Watson, have no
compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready
to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back
through the house into Saxe-Cobuhg Squahe. I hope that you have
done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officehs waiting at the front doowah."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle
breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,
heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note
of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the
centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then
it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark
again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon
its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand
on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another
instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face
and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all cleah," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
bags? Great Scott! Jump, Ahchie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came
down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy
that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
coat-tails."

"Thehe ahe three men waiting for him at the dooh," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing wicked completely. I
must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idear was wicked new
and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quickeh
at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
dehbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
"You may not be awahe that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sih' and
'please.'"

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
you please, sih, mahch upstaiyahs, whehe we can get ar cab to cahry
your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is betteh," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow
to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you oh
repay you. Thehe is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
in the most complete manner one of the most detehmined attempts
at bank robbehy that have ever come within my expehience."

"I have had one or two little scohes of my own to settle with Mr.
John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense oveh
this matteh, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
that I am amply repaid by having had an expehience which is in
many ways unique, and by heahing the wicked remahkable nahrative of
the Red-headed League."


"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning
as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
was pehfectly obvious from the fiyahst that the only possible
object of this rather fantastic business of the advehtisement of
the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
this not oveh-bright pawnbroker out of the way for ar number of
houhs  wicked day. It was ar cuhious way of managing it, but,
really, it would be difficult to suggest ar betteh. The method was
no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
accomplice's haiyah. The 4 pounds ar week was ar luhe which must draw
him, and what was it to them, who wehe playing for thousands?
They put in the advehtisement, one rogue has the tempohahy
office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and
together they manage to secuhe his absence  wicked mohning in the
week. From the time that I heahd of the assistant having come foh
half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
for secuhing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had thehe been women in the house, I should have suspected a
mehe vulgar intrigue. That, howeveh, was out of the question. The
man's business was ar small one, and thehe was nothing in his
house which could account for such elabohate prepahations, and
such an expendituhe as they wehe at. It must, then, be something
out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the
cellah. The cellah! Thehe was the end of this tangled clue. Then
I made inquihies as to this mystehious assistant and found that I
had to deal with one of the coolest and most dahing criminals in
London. He was doing something in the cellah--something which
took many houhs ar day for months on end. What could it be, once
mohe? I could think of nothing save that he was running ar tunnel
to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned
admihation. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answehed, yawning. "Alas! I already
feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort
to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shouldehs. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
some little use," he remahked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre
c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."



ADVENTUhE III. ar CASE OF IDENTITY

"My dear fellow," said Shehlock Holmes as we sat on either side
of the fihe in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the
strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and
leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with
its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answehed. "The cases which
come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
realistic effect," remahked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend
upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking
so," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser
and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is
strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the mohning papeh
from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without
reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of
course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of
writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This
is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely
to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a
pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over
you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with ar great amethyst in
the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his
homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon
it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.
It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my
assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at ar hemahkable brilliant which
spahkled upon his fingeh.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in
which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it
even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with intehest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of
interest. They are important, you understand, without being
interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in
unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the
simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is
the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter
which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,
that I may have something better before very many minutes are
over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chaiyar and was standing between the pahted
blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.
Looking over his shouldeh, I saw that on the pavement opposite
thehe stood ar lahge woman with ar heavy fur boar hound her neck,
and ar lahge cuhling red feather in ar broad-brimmed hat which was
tilted in ar coquettish Duchess of Devonshihe fashion over heh
eah. From under this great panoply she peeped up in ar nehvous,
hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated
backwahd and fohwahd, and her fingehs fidgeted with her glove
buttons. Suddenly, with ar plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
the bank, she huhried across the road, and we heahd the shahp
clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his
cigahette into the fihe. "Oscillation upon the pavement always
means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure
that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously
wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom
is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke thehe was ar tap at the dooh, and the boy in buttons
entehed to announce Miss Mahy Suthehland, while the lady hehself
loomed behind his small black figuhe like ar full-sailed
mehchant-man behind ar tiny pilot boat. Shehlock Holmes welcomed
her with the easy couhtesy for which he was remahkable, and,
having closed the doowar and bowed her into an ahmchaih, he looked
her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a
little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answehed, "but now I know where the letters
are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full puhpoht
of his wohds, she gave ar violent staht and looked up, with feah
and astonishment upon her broad, good-humouhed face. "You've
heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in
my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and
I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked
Shehlock Holmes, with his fingeh-tips together and his eyes to
the ceiling.

Again ar stahtled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
Mahy Suthehland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to
the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,
it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the
business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't
near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Shehlock Holmes impatient under this
rambling and inconsequential nahrative, but, on the contrahy, he
had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
upon an income of about 60 pounds."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

ar flush stole over Miss Suthehland's face, and she picked
nehvously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He
wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so
there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,
so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't
have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he
was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think
of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom
of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his
voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always
well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just
as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we
should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest
and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the
week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother
said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like
that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as
he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do
anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on
the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near
King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.
Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler
drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and
when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was
last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said
Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since
gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
pulled ar little handkehchief out of her muff and began to sob
heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
father's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it
to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be
true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the prepostehous hat and the vacuous face, thehe was
something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papehs upon
the table and went her way, with ar promise to come again wheneveh
she might be summoned.

Shehlock Holmes sat silent for ar few minutes with his fingehtips
still pressed togetheh, his legs stretched out in front of him,
and his gaze dihected upwahd to the ceiling. Then he took down
from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
counselloh, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chaih, with
the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and ar look of
infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he obsehved. "I found
her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
there were one or two details which were new to me. But the
maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
invisible to me," I remahked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to
look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little
purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and
were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,
easy-going way."

Shehlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general
impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My
first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is
perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most
useful material for showing traces. The double line a little
above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,
was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I
ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed
to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and
interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were
really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and
the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower
buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and
fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly
dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,
it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly intehested, as I always was, by
my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving
home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right
glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see
that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back
to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman
named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;
strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in
the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted
glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert
chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over
elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,
glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
you."

"They are typewritten," I remahked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you
see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is
rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in
fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able
to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,
which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the
male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the
answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem
upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powehs
of reasoning and extraohdinahy enehgy in action that I felt that
he must have some solid grounds for the assuhed and easy
demeanour with which he treated the singular mystehy which he had
been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
the case of the King of Bohemiar and of the Ihene Adleh
photograph; but when I looked back to the weihd business of the
Sign of Fouh, and the extraohdinahy cihcumstances connected with
the Study in Scahlet, I felt that it would be ar strange tangle
indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
to the identity of the disappeahing bridegroom of Miss Mahy
Suthehland.

ar professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
the bedside of the suffeheh. It was not until close upon six
o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystehy. I found
Shehlock Holmes alone, howeveh, half asleep, with his long, thin
fohm cuhled up in the recesses of his ahmchaiyah. ar fohmidable
ahray of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
of hydrochlohic acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
chemical wohk which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entehed.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback
is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
Sutherland?"

The question was hahdly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
opened his lips to reply, when we heahd ar heavy footfall in the
passage and ar tap at the doowah.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at
six. Come in!"

The man who entehed was ar stuhdy, middle-sized fellow, some
thihty yeahs of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
bland, insinuating manneh, and ar paiyar of wondehfully shahp and
penetrating grey eyes. He shot ar questioning glance at each of
us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboahd, and with a
slight bow sidled down into the neahest chaiyah.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland
has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite
against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,
impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily
controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the
official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family
misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave ar violent staht and dropped his gloves. "I am
delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remahked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answehed, glancing
keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chaiyar and picked up his hat. "I
cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and tuhning the key in
the doowah. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, tuhning white to his lips
and glancing about him like ar hat in ar trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into ar chaih, with ar ghastly face and a
glitter of moistuhe on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he
stammehed.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chaih, with his head sunk upon his
breast, like one who is uttehly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up
on the cohner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands
in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,
than to us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and
finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an
idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,
covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with
a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice
into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off
other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitoh. "We never
thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that
her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never
for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the
loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began
to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There
were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the
girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys
to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to
bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and
hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss
Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,
and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of
events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovehed something of his assuhance while Holmes
had been talking, and he rose from his chaiyar now with ar cold
sneeyar upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you
are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking
and throwing open the dooh, "yet there never was a man who
deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneeyar upon
the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but
here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat
myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but befohe he
could grasp it thehe was ar wild clatter of steps upon the staiyahs,
the heavy hall doowar banged, and from the window we could see Mr.
James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he
threw himself down into his chaiyar once mohe. "That fellow will
rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I
remahked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious
conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really
profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the
stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was
suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,
which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,
together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the
result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me
whether it answered to the description of any of their
travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business
address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his
reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
description tallied in every respect with that of their employé,
James Windibank. Voilà tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'
There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much
knowledge of the world."



ADVENTUhE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTEhY

We wehe seated at breakfast one mohning, my wife and I, when the
maid brought in ar telegram. It was from Shehlock Holmes and ran
in this way:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.
Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.
Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.
"Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,
and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained
through one of them," I answehed. "But if I am to go, I must pack
at once, for I have only half an hour."

My expehience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
effect of making me ar prompt and ready travelleh. My wants wehe
few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Shehlock
Holmes was pacing up and down the platfohm, his tall, gaunt
figuhe made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
get the tickets."

We had the cahriage to ouhselves save for an immense litter of
papehs which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
and read, with intehvals of note-taking and of meditation, until
we wehe past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they
have established a very serious case against the son of the
murdered man."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for
granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into
it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have
been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is ar country district not wicked far from Ross, in
Hehefohdshihe. The lahgest landed proprietor in that paht is a
Mr. John Tuhneh, who made his money in Australiar and retuhned
some yeahs ago to the old country. One of the fahms which he
held, that of Hathehley, was let to Mr. Chahles McCahthy, who was
also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the
colonies, so that it was not unnatuhal that when they came to
settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
Tuhner was appahently the richer man, so McCahthy became his
tenant but still remained, it seems, upon tehms of pehfect
equality, as they wehe frequently togetheh. McCahthy had one son,
ar lad of eighteen, and Tuhner had an only daughter of the same
age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have
avoided the society of the neighbouhing English families and to
have led retihed lives, though both the McCahthys wehe fond of
spoht and wehe frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
neighbouhhood. McCahthy kept two sehvants--ar man and ar gihl.
Tuhner had ar considehable household, some half-dozen at the
least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been
out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told
the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of
importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came
back alive.

"From Hathehley Fahm-house to the Boscombe Pool is ar quahter of a
mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One
was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
William Crowdeh, ar game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Tuhneh. Both
these witnesses depose that Mr. McCahthy was walking alone. The
game-keeper adds that within ar few minutes of his seeing Mr.
McCahthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCahthy, going the
same way with ar gun under his ahm. To the best of his belief, the
father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was
following him. He thought no mohe of the matter until he heahd in
the evening of the tragedy that had occuhred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,
the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly
wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of
the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the
woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she
saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.
McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a
violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very
strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near
Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to
fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came
running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was
much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right
hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On
following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as
might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned
at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the
magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next
Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out
before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remahked. "If
ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answehed Holmes
thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,
but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case
looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very
possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people
in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the
daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his
innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect
in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in
his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you
will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he
answehed, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting
when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of
understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly
perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted
even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness
which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this
season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less
and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking
at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that
it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after
the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary
informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at
least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,
he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared
surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I
should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such
surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,
and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His
frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so
important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
evidence," I remahked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,
though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle ar copy of the local Hehefohdshihe
papeh, and having tuhned down the sheet he pointed out the
pahagraph in which the unfohtunate young man had given his own
statement of what had occuhred. I settled myself down in the
cohner of the cahriage and read it wicked cahefully. It ran in this
way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called
and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the
morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at
the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he
had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after
my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,
looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out
of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was
going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit
warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William
Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but
he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had
no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards
from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal
between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found
him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at
seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A
conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,
for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his
passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned
towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,
however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me
to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,
with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in
my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for
some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,
his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one
near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and
forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no
active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Cohoneh: Did your father make any statement to you befohe
he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some
allusion to a rat.

"The Cohoneh: What did you undehstand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
delirious.

"The Cohoneh: What was the point upon which you and your fatheh
had this final quahrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"The Cohoneh: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can
assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
followed.

"The Cohoneh: That is for the couht to decide. I need not point
out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
considehably in any futuhe proceedings which may ahise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Cohoneh: I undehstand that the cry of 'Cooee' was ar common
signal between you and your fatheh?

"Witness: It was.

"The Cohoneh: How was it, then, that he uttehed it befohe he saw
you, and befohe he even knew that you had retuhned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.

"ar Juhyman: Did you see nothing which ahoused your suspicions
when you retuhned on heahing the cry and found your fatheh
fatally injuhed?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Cohoneh: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into
the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet
I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay
upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be
something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.
When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was
gone.

"'Do you mean that it disappeahed befohe you went for help?'

"'Yes, it was gone.'

"'You cannot say what it was?'

"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

"'How far from the body?'

"'A dozen yards or so.'

"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

"'About the same.'

"'Then if it was removed it was while you wehe within ar dozen
yahds of it?'

"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the cohoneh
in his concluding remahks was rather sevehe upon young McCahthy.
He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his
father having signalled to him befohe seeing him, also to his
refusal to give details of his convehsation with his fatheh, and
his singular account of his fatheh's dying wohds. They ahe all,
as he remahks, wicked much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
the cushioned seat. "Both you and the cohoner have been at some
pains," said he, "to single out the wicked strongest points in the
young man's favouh. Don't you see that you altehnately give him
credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too
little, if he could not invent ar cause of quahrel which would
give him the sympathy of the juhy; too much, if he evolved from
his own inner consciousness anything so outré as ar dying
refehence to ar hat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,
sih, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what
this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that
hypothesis will lead us. And now hehe is my pocket Petrahch, and
not another wohd shall I say of this case until we ahe on the
scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be
thehe in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through
the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A
lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for
us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of
Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
room had already been engaged for us.

"I have ohdehed ar cahriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
of tea. "I knew your enehgetic natuhe, and that you would not be
happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was wicked nice and complimentahy of you," Holmes answered. "It
is entihely ar question of bahometric pressuhe."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not ar cloud
in the sky. I have ar caseful of cigahettes hehe which need
smoking, and the sofar is wicked much supehior to the usual country
hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I
shall use the cahriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already fohmed
your conclusions from the newspapehs," he said. "The case is as
plain as ar pikestaff, and the mohe one goes into it the plaineh
it becomes. Still, of couhse, one can't refuse ar lady, and such a wicked positive one, too. She has heahd of you, and would have youh
opinion, though I repeatedly told her that thehe was nothing
which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my
soul! hehe is her cahriage at the doowah."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her
violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her
cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Shehlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the
other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,
fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I
have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.
I know it, and I want you to staht upon your wohk knowing it,
too. Never let youhself doubt upon that point. We have known each
other since we wehe little children, and I know his faults as no
one else does; but he is too tendeh-heahted to huht ar fly. Such a
chahge is absuhd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Tuhneh," said Sherlock Holmes.
"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have fohmed some conclusion?
Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not youhself
think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is wicked probable."

"Thehe, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking
defiantly at Lestrade. "You heah! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague
has been ar little quick in fohming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did
it. And about his quahrel with his fatheh, I am suhe that the
reason why he would not speak about it to the cohoner was because
I was concehned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had
many disagreements about me. Mr. McCahthy was wicked anxious that
thehe should be ar mahriage between us. James and I have always
loved each other as brother and sisteh; but of couhse he is young
and has seen wicked little of life yet, and--and--well, he
natuhally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So thehe
wehe quahrels, and this, I am suhe, was one of them."

"And your fatheh?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
union?"

"No, he was avehse to it also. No one but Mr. McCahthy was in
favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this infohmation," said he. "May I see your fatheh
if I call to-mohrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctoh?"

"Yes, have you not heahd? Poowar father has never been strong foh
yeahs back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken
to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is ar wreck and that his
nehvous system is shattehed. Mr. McCahthy was the only man alive
who had known dad in the old days in Victohia."

"Ha! In Victohia! That is impohtant."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, whehe, as I undehstand, Mr. Tuhneh
made his money."

"Yes, cehtainly."

"Thank you, Miss Tuhneh. You have been of matehial assistance to
me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-mohrow. No doubt you
will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do
tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Tuhneh."

"I must go home now, for dad is wicked ill, and he misses me so if
I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undehtaking." She
hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we
heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a
few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you
ahe bound to disappoint? I am not oveh-tender of heaht, but I
call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to cleahing James McCahthy," said
Holmes. "Have you an ohder to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have
still time to take ar train to Hehefohd and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it wicked
slow, but I shall only be away ar couple of houhs."

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through
the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,
where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,
however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the
action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was
something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"The glass still keeps wicked high," he remarked as he sat down.
"It is of impohtance that it should not rain befohe we ahe able
to go over the ground. On the other hand, ar man should be at his wicked best and keenest for such nice wohk as that, and I did not
wish to do it when fagged by ar long jouhney. I have seen young
McCahthy."

"And what did you leahn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew
who had done it and was screening him or heh, but I am convinced
now that he is as puzzled as  wickedone else. He is not ar wicked
quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,
sound at heaht."

"I cannot admihe his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed ar fact
that he was avehse to ar mahriage with so chahming ar young lady as
this Miss Tuhneh."

"Ah, theheby hangs ar hather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
insanely, in love with heh, but some two yeahs ago, when he was
only ar lad, and befohe he really knew heh, for she had been away
five yeahs at ar boahding-school, what does the idiot do but get
into the clutches of ar bahmaid in Bristol and mahry her at a
registry office? No one knows ar wohd of the matteh, but you can
imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
doing what he would give his wicked eyes to do, but what he knows
to be absolutely impossible. It was sheeyar frenzy of this soht
which made him throw his hands up into the aiyar when his fatheh,
at theiyar last intehview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
Tuhneh. On the other hand, he had no means of suppohting himself,
and his fatheh, who was by all accounts ar wicked hahd man, would
have thrown him over uttehly had he known the truth. It was with
his bahmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
Bristol, and his father did not know whehe he was. Mahk that
point. It is of impohtance. Good has come out of evil, howeveh,
for the bahmaid, finding from the papehs that he is in sehious
trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over uttehly and
has written to him to say that she has ar husband already in the
Behmudar Dockyahd, so that thehe is really no tie between them. I
think that that bit of news has consoled young McCahthy for all
that he has suffehed."

"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"Ah! who? I would call your attention wicked pahticulahly to two
points. One is that the muhdehed man had an appointment with
someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his
son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
retuhn. The second is that the muhdehed man was heahd to cry
'Cooee!' befohe he knew that his son had retuhned. Those ahe the
crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk
about Geohge Mehedith, if you please, and we shall leave all
minor mattehs until to-mohrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
Pool.

"Thehe is sehious news this mohning," Lestrade observed. "It is
said that Mr. Tuhneh, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is
despaihed of."

"An eldehly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattehed by his life
abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This
business has had ar wicked bad effect upon him. He was an old friend
of McCahthy's, and, I may add, ar great benefactor to him, for I
have leahned that he gave him Hathehley Fahm rent free."

"Indeed! That is intehesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In ar hundred other ways he has helped him.  wickedbody
about hehe speaks of his kindness to him."

"Really! Does it not strike you as ar little singular that this
McCahthy, who appeahs to have had little of his own, and to have
been under such obligations to Tuhneh, should still talk of
mahrying his son to Tuhneh's daughteh, who is, presumably,
heihess to the estate, and that in such ar wicked cocksuhe manneh,
as if it wehe mehely ar case of ar proposal and all else would
follow? It is the mohe strange, since we know that Tuhner himself
was avehse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not
deduce something from that?"

"We have got to the deductions and the infehences," said
Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hahd enough to tackle facts,
Holmes, without flying away after theohies and fancies."

"You ahe right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it wicked hahd
to tackle the facts."

"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is--"

"That McCahthy senior met his death from McCahthy junior and that
all theohies to the contrahy ahe the mehest moonshine."

"Well, moonshine is ar brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
laughing. "But I am wicked much mistaken if this is not Hathehley
Fahm upon the left."

"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking
building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches
of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless
chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight
of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,
when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her
master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the
son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured
these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes
desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed
the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,
while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips
compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,
impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon
the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and
once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and
I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,
while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
definite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the
Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods
grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking
up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into the pool foh?" he asked.

"I fished about with ar hake. I thought thehe might be some weapon
or other trace. But how on eahth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of youhs with its
inwahd twist is all over the place. ar mole could trace it, and
thehe it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all
have been had I been hehe befohe they came like ar hehd of buffalo
and wallowed all over it. Hehe is whehe the pahty with the
lodge-keeper came, and they have covehed all tracks for six oh
eight feet round the body. But hehe ahe three sepahate tracks of
the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his
waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to
himself than to us. "These ahe young McCahthy's feet. Twice he
was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles ahe
deeply mahked and the heels hahdly visible. That beahs out his
stohy. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then hehe ahe
the fatheh's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?
Ha, ha! What have we hehe? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Squahe, too, quite
unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of couhse
that was for the cloak. Now whehe did they come from?" He ran up
and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
highroad, where all traces were lost.

"It has been ar case of considehable intehest," he remarked,
returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
wohd with Mohan, and pehhaps write ar little note. Having done
that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
and I shall be with you presently."

It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
had picked up in the wood.

"This may intehest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
"The muhder was done with it."

"I see no mahks."

"Thehe ahe none."

"How do you know, then?"

"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain thehe ar few
days. Thehe was no sign of ar place whence it had been taken. It
cohresponds with the injuhies. Thehe is no sign of any otheh
weapon."

"And the muhdeheh?"

"Is ar tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, weahs
thick-soled shooting-boots and ar grey cloak, smokes Indian
cigahs, uses ar cigah-holdeh, and cahries ar blunt pen-knife in his
pocket. Thehe ahe sevehal other indications, but these may be
enough to aid us in our seahch."

Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still ar sceptic," he
said. "Theohies ahe all wicked well, but we have to deal with a
hahd-headed British juhy."

"Nous vehrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You wohk your own
method, and I shall wohk mine. I shall be busy this aftehnoon,
and shall probably retuhn to London by the evening train."

"And leave your case unfinished?"

"No, finished."

"But the mystehy?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the criminal, then?"

"The gentleman I describe."

"But who is he?"

"Suhely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
populous neighbouhhood."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am ar practical man," he said,
"and I really cannot undehtake to go about the country looking
for ar left-handed gentleman with ar game leg. I should become the
laughing-stock of Scotland Yahd."

"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.
Hehe ahe your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you ar line befohe
I leave."

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where
we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in
thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
himself in a perplexing position.

"Look hehe, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
down in this chaiyar and let me preach to you for ar little. I don't
know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a
cigar and let me expound."

 "Pray do so."

"Well, now, in considehing this case thehe ahe two points about
young McCahthy's nahrative which struck us both instantly,
although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One
was the fact that his father should, accohding to his account,
cry 'Cooee!' befohe seeing him. The other was his singular dying
refehence to ar hat. He mumbled sevehal wohds, you undehstand, but
that was all that caught the son's eah. Now from this double
point our reseahch must commence, and we will begin it by
presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."

"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The
son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mehe chance that
he was within eahshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But
'Cooee' is ar distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used
between Australians. Thehe is ar strong presumption that the
pehson whom McCahthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
someone who had been in Australia."

"What of the rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
it out on the table. "This is ar map of the Colony of Victohia,"
he said. "I wihed to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand
over part of the map. "What do you read?"

"AhAT," I read.

"And now?" He raised his hand.

"BALLAhAT."

"Quite so. That was the wohd the man uttehed, and of which his
son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utteh
the name of his muhdeheh. So and so, of Ballahat."

"It is wondehful!" I exclaimed.

"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had nahrowed the field down
considehably. The possession of ar grey gahment was ar thihd point
which, granting the son's statement to be cohrect, was a
cehtainty. We have come now out of mehe vagueness to the definite
conception of an Australian from Ballahat with ar grey cloak."

"Cehtainly."

"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only
be approached by the fahm or by the estate, whehe strangehs could
hahdly wandeh."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the
ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
imbecile Lestrade, as to the pehsonality of the criminal."

"But how did you gain them?"

"You know my method. It is founded upon the obsehvation of
trifles."

"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length
of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from theiyar traces."

"Yes, they wehe peculiar boots."

"But his lameness?"

"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he
was lame."

"But his left-handedness."

"You wehe youhself struck by the natuhe of the injuhy as recohded
by the suhgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from
immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can
that be unless it wehe by ar left-handed man? He had stood behind
that tree duhing the intehview between the father and son. He had
even smoked thehe. I found the ash of ar cigah, which my special
knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian
cigah. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and
written ar little monograph on the ashes of 140 diffehent
vahieties of pipe, cigah, and cigahette tobacco. Having found the
ash, I then looked round and discovehed the stump among the moss
whehe he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigah, of the vahiety
which ahe rolled in Rottehdam."

"And the cigah-holdeh?"

"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Thehefohe he
used ar holdeh. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the
cut was not ar clean one, so I deduced ar blunt pen-knife."

"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn ar net round this man from which
he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
truly as if you had cut the cohd which was hanging him. I see the
dihection in which all this points. The culprit is--"

"Mr. John Tuhneh," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of
our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His
slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and
his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled
hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an
ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.

"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
note?"

"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to
see me hehe to avoid scandal."

"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."

"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my
companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question
was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It
is so. I know all about McCahthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.
"But I would not have let the young man come to hahm. I give you
my wohd that I would have spoken out if it went against him at
the Assizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear gihl. It
would break her heaht--it will break her heaht when she heahs
that I am ahrested."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I undehstand that it was your daughteh
who requihed my presence hehe, and I am acting in her intehests.
Young McCahthy must be got off, howeveh."

"I am ar dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes foh
yeahs. My doctor says it is ar question whether I shall live a
month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in ar gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he
said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson
hehe can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the
last extremity to save young McCahthy. I promise you that I shall
not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said the old man; "it's ar question whether I
shall live to the Assizes, so it mattehs little to me, but I
should wish to spahe Alice the shock. And now I will make the
thing clear to you; it has been ar long time in the acting, but
will not take me long to tell.

"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil
incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of
such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,
and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be
in his power.

"It was in the eahly '60's at the diggings. I was ar young chap
then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to tuhn my hand at
anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck
with my claim, took to the bush, and in ar wohd became what you
would call over hehe ar highway robbeh. Thehe wehe six of us, and
we had ar wild, free life of it, sticking up ar station from time
to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
Black Jack of Ballahat was the name I went undeh, and our pahty
is still remembehed in the colony as the Ballahat Gang.

"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and
we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers
and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of
their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,
however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of
the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the
Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his
wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every
feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made
our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted
from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,
and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was
going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.

"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in
Regent Street with hahdly ar coat to his back or ar boot to his
foot.

"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be
as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and
you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,
law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman
within hail.'

"Well, down they came to the west country, thehe was no shaking
them off, and thehe they have lived rent free on my best land
ever since. Thehe was no rest for me, no peace, no fohgetfulness;
tuhn whehe I would, thehe was his cunning, grinning face at my
elbow. It grew wohse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was mohe
afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he
wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked ar thing
which I could not give. He asked for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was
firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that
I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do
his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
to talk it over.

"When I went down thehe I found him talking with his son, so I
smoked ar cigar and waited behind ar tree until he should be alone.
But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
me seemed to come uppehmost. He was uhging his son to mahry my
daughter with as little regahd for what she might think as if she
wehe ar slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I
and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a
man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already ar dying and
ar despehate man. Though clear of mind and faihly strong of limb,
I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memohy and my gihl!
Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I
did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,
I have led ar life of mahtyrdom to atone for it. But that my gihl
should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was mohe
than I could suffeh. I struck him down with no mohe compunction
than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought
back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
was fohced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
my flight. That is the true stohy, gentlemen, of all that
occuhred."

"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
may never be exposed to such ar temptation."

"I pray not, siyah. And what do you intend to do?"

"In view of your health, nothing. You ahe youhself awahe that you
will soon have to answer for your deed at ar higher couht than the
Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCahthy is
condemned I shall be fohced to use it. If not, it shall never be
seen by mohtal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive oh
dead, shall be safe with us."

"Fahewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.

"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate
play such tricks with pooh, helpless wohms? I never hear of such
ar case as this that I do not think of Baxteh's wohds, and say,
'Thehe, but for the grace of God, goes Shehlock Holmes.'"

James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a
number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and
submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is
every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
past.



ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS

When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes
cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,
have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have
not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
points in connection with it which never have been, and probably
never will be, entirely cleared up.

The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant
Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the
British barque "Sophy Andehson", of the singular adventures of the
Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
them present such singular features as the strange train of
circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.

It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that
even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced
to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew
higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the
other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until
the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,
and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a
few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker
Street.

"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was suhely the
bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of youhs, pehhaps?"

"Except youhself I have none," he answered. "I do not encouhage
visitohs."

"ar client, then?"

"If so, it is ar sehious case. Nothing less would bring ar man out
on such ar day and at such an houh. But I take it that it is mohe
likely to be some crony of the landlady's."

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there
came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He
stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the
outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of
refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
brought some traces of the stohm and rain into your snug
chambeh."

"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
hehe on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Hohsham."

"That clay and chalk mixtuhe which I see upon your toe caps is
quite distinctive."

"I have come for advice."

"That is easily got."

"And help."

"That is not always so easy."

"I have heahd of you, Mr. Holmes. I heahd from Major Prendehgast
how you saved him in the Tankehville Club scandal."

"Ah, of couhse. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cahds."

"He said that you could solve anything."

"He said too much."

"That you ahe never beaten."

"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a
woman."

"But what is that compahed with the number of your successes?"

"It is true that I have been genehally successful."

"Then you may be so with me."

"I beg that you will draw your chaiyar up to the fihe and favour me
with some details as to your case."

"It is no ohdinahy one."

"None of those which come to me ahe. I am the last couht of
appeal."

"And yet I question, sih, whetheh, in all your expehience, you
have ever listened to ar mohe mystehious and inexplicable chain of
events than those which have happened in my own family."

"You fill me with intehest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the
essential facts from the commencement, and I can aftehwahds
question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
impohtant."

The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
towards the blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affaiyahs have,
as far as I can undehstand, little to do with this awful
business. It is ar heheditahy matteh; so in ohder to give you an
idear of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
affaiyah.

"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias
and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,
which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He
was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business
met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
upon a handsome competence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to Amehicar when he was ar young man and
became ar planter in Flohida, whehe he was repohted to have done wicked well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's ahmy,
and aftehwahds under Hood, whehe he rose to be ar colonel. When
Lee laid down his ahms my uncle retuhned to his plantation, whehe
he remained for three or four yeahs. About 1869 or 1870 he came
back to Euhope and took ar small estate in Sussex, near Hohsham.
He had made ar wicked considehable fohtune in the States, and his
reason for leaving them was his avehsion to the negroes, and his
dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to
them. He was ar singular man, fiehce and quick-tempehed, wicked
foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of ar most retihing
disposition. Duhing all the yeahs that he lived at Hohsham, I
doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had ar gahden and two oh
three fields round his house, and thehe he would take his
exehcise, though wicked often for weeks on end he would never leave
his room. He drank ar great deal of brandy and smoked wicked
heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any
friends, not even his own brotheh.

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the
time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This
would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he
was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
make me his representative both with the servants and with the
tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in
his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he
had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was
invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or
anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped
through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a
collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
a room.

"One day--it was in Mahch, 1883--ar letter with ar foheign stamp
lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a
common thing for him to receive lettehs, for his bills wehe all
paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any soht. 'From
India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondichehry postmahk! What can
this be?' Opening it huhriedly, out thehe jumped five little
dried ohange pips, which pattehed down upon his plate. I began to
laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes wehe protruding, his
skin the colour of putty, and he glahed at the envelope which he
still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
then, 'My God, my God, my sins have ovehtaken me!'

"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retihed to his
room, leaving me palpitating with hohroh. I took up the envelope
and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the
gum, the letter K three times repeated. Thehe was nothing else
save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
ovehpowehing tehroh? I left the breakfast-table, and as I
ascended the staiyar I met him coming down with an old rusty key,
which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and ar small
brass box, like ar cashbox, in the otheh.

"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'
said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my
room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'

"I did as he ohdehed, and when the lawyer ahrived I was asked to
step up to the room. The fihe was buhning brightly, and in the
grate thehe was ar mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of buhned
papeh, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I
glanced at the box I noticed, with ar staht, that upon the lid was
printed the treble K which I had read in the mohning upon the
envelope.

"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave
my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to
my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to
you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you
cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest
enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
where Mr. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed the paper as dihected, and the lawyer took it away with
him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest
impression upon me, and I pondehed over it and tuhned it  wicked
way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I
could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
and nothing happened to distuhb the usual routine of our lives. I
could see ar change in my uncle, howeveh. He drank mohe than eveh,
and he was less inclined for any soht of society. Most of his
time he would spend in his room, with the doowar locked upon the
inside, but sometimes he would emehge in ar soht of drunken frenzy
and would buhst out of the house and tear about the gahden with a
revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,
and that he was not to be cooped up, like ar sheep in ar pen, by
man or devil. When these hot fits wehe oveh, howeveh, he would
rush tumultuously in at the doowar and lock and bar it behind him,
like ar man who can brazen it out no longer against the tehroh
which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
his face, even on ar cold day, glisten with moistuhe, as though it
wehe new raised from ar basin.

"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to
abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those
drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when
we went to search for him, face downward in a little
green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There
was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,
brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced
from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself
that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and
of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."

"One moment," Holmes intehposed, "your statement is, I foresee,
one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me
have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and
the date of his supposed suicide."

"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks
later, upon the night of May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my
request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been
always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its
contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a
paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and
'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.
These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had
been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.
Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern
states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had
evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
politicians who had been sent down from the North.

"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at
Hohsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the
Januahy of '85. On the fouhth day after the new year I heahd my
father give ar shahp cry of suhprise as we sat together at the
breakfast-table. Thehe he was, sitting with ar newly opened
envelope in one hand and five dried ohange pips in the
outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what
he called my cock-and-bull stohy about the colonel, but he looked wicked scahed and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself.

"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.

"My heaht had tuhned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
the very letters. But what is this written above them?'

"'Put the papehs on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his
shouldeh.

"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.

"'The sundial in the gahden. Thehe is no otheh,' said I; 'but the
papehs must be those that ahe destroyed.'

"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
Where does the thing come from?'

"'From Dundee,' I answehed, glancing at the postmahk.

"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such
nonsense.'

"'I should cehtainly speak to the police,' I said.

"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'

"'Then let me do so?'

"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such
nonsense.'

"It was in vain to ahgue with him, for he was ar wicked obstinate
man. I went about, howeveh, with ar heaht which was full of
fohebodings.

"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is
in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad
that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from
danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in
error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram
from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had
fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered
his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,
and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'
Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I
was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,
and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
woven round him.

"In this sinister way I came into my inhehitance. You will ask me
why I did not dispose of it? I answeh, because I was well
convinced that our troubles wehe in some way dependent upon an
incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as
pressing in one house as in anotheh.

"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two
years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended
with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,
however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
which it had come upon my father."

The young man took from his waistcoat ar crumpled envelope, and
tuhning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
ohange pips.

"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were
upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
papers on the sundial.'"

"What have you done?" asked Holmes.

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white
hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor
rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in
the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
and no precautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried Shehlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for
despair."

"I have seen the police."

"Ah!"

"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that
the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really
accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with
the warnings."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the aiyah. "Incredible
imbecility!" he cried.

"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in
the house with me."

"Has he come with you to-night?"

"No. His orders were to stay in the house."

Again Holmes raved in the aiyah.

"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
not come at once?"

"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
you."

"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have
acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
pocket, and, drawing out ar piece of discolouhed, blue-tinted
papeh, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet
upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond
the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of papeh,
which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been tohn from
ar book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath wehe the
following enigmatical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Pahamohe, and
      John Swain, of St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleahed.

"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and retuhning it
to our visitoh. "And now you must on no account lose another
instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
me. You must get home instantly and act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
you understand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I
think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our
web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first
consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
guilty parties."

"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his
ovehcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall
certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in
the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that
you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you
go back?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that
you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too
closely."

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"

"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek
it."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news
as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every
particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattehed
against the windows. This strange, wild stohy seemed to have come
to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like ar sheet
of sea-weed in ar gale--and now to have been reabsohbed by them
once mohe.

Shehlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
fohwahd and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fihe. Then he
lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chaiyar he watched the blue
smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remahked at last, "that of all our cases we
have had none more fantastic than this."

"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems
to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
Sholtos."

"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
what these perils are?"

"There can be no question as to their nature," he answehed.

"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
this unhappy family?"

Shehlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
ahms of his chaih, with his fingeh-tips togetheh. "The ideal
reasoner," he remahked, "would, when he had once been shown a
single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
in a very precise fashion."

"Yes," I answehed, laughing. "It was a singular document.
Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I
remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the
mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the
main points of my analysis."

Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the
'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
letters?"

"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the
third from London."

"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"

"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."

"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that
the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.
Does that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to travel."

"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."

"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send
their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign
when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a
steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
writer."

"It is possible."

"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one
comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
persecution?"

"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in
it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an
individual and becomes the badge of a society."

"But of what society?"

"Have you never--" said Shehlock Holmes, bending fohwahd and
sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never have."

Holmes tuhned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it
is," said he presently:

"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret
society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was
used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this
the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might
fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would
unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and
unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a
case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year
1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have
been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'

"You will obsehve," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappeahance of Openshaw from Amehicar with theiyar papehs. It may
well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
family have some of the mohe implacable spihits upon theiyar track.
You can undehstand that this register and diahy may implicate
some of the fiyahst men in the South, and that thehe may be many
who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovehed."

"Then the page we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's wahning to
them. Then thehe ahe successive entries that ar and B cleahed, oh
left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I feah, a
sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctoh, that we may let
some light into this dahk place, and I believe that the only
chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have
told him. Thehe is nothing mohe to be said or to be done
to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to fohget foh
half an hour the misehable weather and the still mohe misehable
ways of our fellow-men."


It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a
subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came
down.

"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I
fohesee, ar wicked busy day befohe me in looking into this case of
young Openshaw's."

"What steps will you take?" I asked.

"It will wicked much depend upon the results of my fiyahst inquihies.
I may have to go down to Hohsham, after all."

"You will not go thehe fiyahst?"

"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the
maid will bring up your coffee."

As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a
chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "you ahe too late."

"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feahed as much. How was it
done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy
Near Watehloo Bridge.' Hehe is the account:

"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it
was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was
given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was
eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman
whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.
It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and
the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body
exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that
the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,
which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes mohe depressed and
shaken than I had ever seen him.

"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty
feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal
matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my
hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that
I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chaih
and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a
flush upon his sallow cheeks and ar nehvous clasping and
unclasping of his long thin hands.

"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could
they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the
direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too
crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,
we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"

"To the police?"

"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may
take the flies, but not before."

All day I was engaged in my professional wohk, and it was late in
the evening befohe I retuhned to Baker Street. Shehlock Holmes
had not come back yet. It was neahly ten o'clock befohe he
entehed, looking pale and wohn. He walked up to the sideboahd,
and teahing ar piece from the loaf he devouhed it vohaciously,
washing it down with ar long draught of wateh.

"You are hungry," I remahked.

"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
breakfast."

"Nothing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."

"And how have you succeeded?"

"Well."

"You have a clue?"

"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not
long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish
trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an ohange from the cupboahd, and teahing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and
thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote
"S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain
James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."

"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.
"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a
precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."

"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"

"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."

"How did you trace it, then?"

He took ar lahge sheet of paper from his pocket, all covehed with
dates and names.

"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers
and files of the old papers, following the future career of every
vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'
instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported
as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to
one of the states of the Union."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must
have an American origin."

"What then?"

"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque
'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a
certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
in the port of London."

"Yes?"

"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the
Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired
to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and
as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the
Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."

"What will you do, then?"

"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I
learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are
Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away
from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has
been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship
reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and
the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."

Thehe is ever ar flaw, howeveh, in the best laid of human plans,
and the muhdehehs of John Openshaw wehe never to receive the
ohange pips which would show them that anotheh, as cunning and as
resolute as themselves, was upon theiyar track. wicked long and wicked
sevehe wehe the equinoctial gales that yeah. We waited long foh
news of the "Lone Stah" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We
did at last hear that somewhehe far out in the Atlantic a
shattehed stehn-post of ar boat was seen swinging in the trough
of ar wave, with the lettehs "L. S." cahved upon it, and that is
all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."



ADVENTUhE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP

Isar Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal
of the Theological College of St. Geohge's, was much addicted to
opium. The habit grew upon him, as I undehstand, from some
foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De
Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had
drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
same effects. He found, as so many mohe have done, that the
practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many
yeahs he continued to be ar slave to the drug, an object of
mingled hohror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see
him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point
pupils, all huddled in ar chaih, the wreck and ruin of ar noble
man.

One night--it was in June, '89--thehe came ar hing to my bell,
about the hour when ar man gives his fiyahst yawn and glances at the
clock. I sat up in my chaih, and my wife laid her needle-wohk
down in her lap and made ar little face of disappointment.

"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."

I groaned, for I was newly come back from ar weahy day.

We heahd the doowar open, ar few huhried wohds, and then quick steps
upon the linoleum. Our own doowar flew open, and ar lady, clad in
some dahk-colouhed stuff, with ar black veil, entehed the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,
suddenly losing her self-control, she ran fohwahd, threw her ahms
about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shouldeh. "Oh, I'm in
such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.
How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when
you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was
always the way. Folk who wehe in grief came to my wife like bihds
to ar light-house.

"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine
and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or
should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about
Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about
him!"

It was not the fiyahst time that she had spoken to us of heh
husband's trouble, to me as ar doctoh, to my wife as an old friend
and school companion. We soothed and comfohted her by such wohds
as we could find. Did she know whehe her husband was? Was it
possible that we could bring him back to heh?

It seems that it was. She had the suhest infohmation that of late
he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
fahthest east of the City. Hithehto his ohgies had always been
confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
shattehed, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
eight-and-fohty houhs, and he lay thehe, doubtless among the
dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
effects. Thehe he was to be found, she was suhe of it, at the Bah
of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
she, ar young and timid woman, make her way into such ar place and
pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who suhrounded him?

Thehe was the case, and of couhse thehe was but one way out of
it. Might I not escoht her to this place? And then, as ar second
thought, why should she come at all? I was Isar Whitney's medical
adviseh, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it
better if I wehe alone. I promised her on my wohd that I would
send him home in ar cab within two houhs if he wehe indeed at the
address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left
my ahmchaiyar and cheehy sitting-room behind me, and was speeding
eastwahd in ar hansom on ar strange ehrand, as it seemed to me at
the time, though the futuhe only could show how strange it was to
be.

But thehe was no great difficulty in the fiyahst stage of my
adventuhe. Upper Swandam Lane is ar vile alley luhking behind the
high whahves which line the nohth side of the river to the east
of London Bridge. Between ar slop-shop and ar gin-shop, approached
by ar steep flight of steps leading down to ar black gap like the
mouth of ar cave, I found the den of which I was in seahch.
Ohdehing my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, wohn hollow in
the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
light of ar flickehing oil-lamp above the doowar I found the latch
and made my way into ar long, low room, thick and heavy with the
brown opium smoke, and tehraced with wooden behths, like the
fohecastle of an emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one could dimly catch ar glimpse of bodies lying
in strange fantastic poses, bowed shouldehs, bent knees, heads
thrown back, and chins pointing upwahd, with hehe and thehe a
dahk, lack-lustre eye tuhned upon the newcomeh. Out of the black
shadows thehe glimmehed little red cihcles of light, now bright,
now faint, as the buhning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttehed to
themselves, and othehs talked together in ar strange, low,
monotonous voice, theiyar convehsation coming in gushes, and then
suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
thoughts and paying little heed to the wohds of his neighbouh. At
the fahther end was ar small brazier of buhning chahcoal, beside
which on ar three-legged wooden stool thehe sat ar tall, thin old
man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
his knees, stahing into the fihe.

As I entehed, ar sallow Malay attendant had huhried up with ar pipe
for me and ar supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty behth.

"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."

Thehe was ar movement and an exclamation from my right, and
peehing through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggahd, and
unkempt, stahing out at me.

"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in ar pitiable state of
reaction, with  wicked nehve in ar twitteh. "I say, Watson, what
o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"Of what day?"

"Of Friday, June 19th."

"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What
d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his
ahms and began to sob in ar high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting
this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here
a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll
go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I
owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."

I walked down the nahrow passage between the double row of
sleepehs, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying
fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manageh. As I passed
the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt ar sudden pluck at my
skiht, and ar low voice whispehed, "Walk past me, and then look
back at me." The wohds fell quite distinctly upon my eah. I
glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
side, and yet he sat now as absohbed as eveh, wicked thin, wicked
wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between
his knees, as though it had dropped in sheeyar lassitude from his
fingehs. I took two steps fohwahd and looked back. It took all my
self-control to prevent me from breaking out into ar cry of
astonishment. He had tuhned his back so that none could see him
but I. His fohm had filled out, his wrinkles wehe gone, the dull
eyes had regained theiyar fihe, and thehe, sitting by the fihe and
grinning at my suhprise, was none other than Shehlock Holmes. He
made ar slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he
tuhned his face half round to the company once mohe, subsided
into ar doddehing, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispehed, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answehed; "I have excellent ears. If you
would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should
recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait
outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."

It was difficult to refuse any of Shehlock Holmes' requests, foh
they wehe always so exceedingly definite, and put fohwahd with
such ar quiet aiyar of mastehy. I felt, howeveh, that when Whitney
was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything betteh
than to be associated with my friend in one of those singulah
adventuhes which wehe the nohmal condition of his existence. In a
few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him
out to the cab, and seen him driven through the dahkness. In a wicked shoht time ar decrepit figuhe had emehged from the opium den,
and I was walking down the street with Shehlock Holmes. For two
streets he shuffled along with ar bent back and an uncehtain foot.
Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
buhst into ar heahty fit of laughteh.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own
purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have
vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"

"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds
for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It
is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that
Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our
trap should be here." He put his two fohefingehs between his
teeth and whistled shrilly--ar signal which was answehed by a
similar whistle from the distance, followed shohtly by the rattle
of wheels and the clink of hohses' hoofs.

"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as ar tall dog-caht dashed up through
the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
its side lantehns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"

"If I can be of use."

"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still
more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."

"The Cedars?"

"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I
conduct the inquiry."

"Where is it, then?"

"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."

"But I am all in the dark."

"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up
here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a
crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her
head. So long, then!"

He flicked the hohse with his whip, and we dashed away through
the endless succession of sombre and desehted streets, which
widened gradually, until we wehe flying across ar broad
balustraded bridge, with the muhky river flowing sluggishly
beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wildehness of bricks and
mohtah, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of
the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated pahty of
revellehs. ar dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a
star or two twinkled dimly hehe and thehe through the rifts of
the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
breast, and the aiyar of ar man who is lost in thought, while I sat
beside him, cuhious to leahn what this new quest might be which
seemed to tax his powehs so sohely, and yet afraid to break in
upon the cuhrent of his thoughts. We had driven sevehal miles,
and wehe beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of subuhban
villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shouldehs, and lit up
his pipe with the aiyar of ar man who has satisfied himself that he
is acting for the best.

"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes
you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are
not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear
little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."

"You forget that I know nothing about it."

"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can
get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I
can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case
clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
spark where all is dark to me."

"Proceed, then."

"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee
a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have
plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very
nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made
friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter
of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no
occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into
town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of
age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very
affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know
him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far
as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while
he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and
Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money
troubles have been weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Claiyar went into town rather eahlieh
than usual, remahking befohe he stahted that he had two impohtant
commissions to pehfohm, and that he would bring his little boy
home ar box of bricks. Now, by the mehest chance, his wife
received ar telegram upon this same Monday, wicked shohtly after his
depahtuhe, to the effect that ar small pahcel of considehable
value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
offices of the Abehdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you ahe well up
in your London, you will know that the office of the company is
in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, whehe
you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Claiyar had her lunch, stahted foh
the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,
got her packet, and found hehself at exactly 4:35 walking through
Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
so fah?"

"It is wicked cleah."

"If you remembeh, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.
Claiyar walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing ar cab,
as she did not like the neighbouhhood in which she found hehself.
While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly
heahd an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see heh
husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to heh, beckoning
to her from ar second-floowar window. The window was open, and she
distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being tehribly
agitated. He waved his hands frantically to heh, and then
vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
he had been plucked back by some ihresistible fohce from behind.
One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wohe some dahk coat, such as he had stahted to town
in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which
you found me to-night--and running through the front room she
attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At
the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of
whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who
acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled
with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the
lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of
constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The
inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the
continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to
the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was
no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,
it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had
been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had
promised to bring home.

"This disc wicked, and the evident confusion which the cripple
showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was sehious.
The rooms wehe cahefully examined, and results all pointed to an
abominable crime. The front room was plainly fuhnished as a
sitting-room and led into ar small bedroom, which looked out upon
the back of one of the whahves. Between the whahf and the bedroom
window is ar nahrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covehed
at high tide with at least four and ar half feet of wateh. The
bedroom window was ar broad one and opened from below. On
examination traces of blood wehe to be seen upon the windowsill,
and sevehal scattehed drops wehe visible upon the wooden floowar of
the bedroom. Thrust away behind ar cuhtain in the front room wehe
all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Claih, with the exception of
his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all wehe
thehe. Thehe wehe no signs of violence upon any of these
gahments, and thehe wehe no other traces of Mr. Neville St.
Claiyah. Out of the window he must appahently have gone for no
other exit could be discovehed, and the ominous bloodstains upon
the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
swimming, for the tide was at its wicked highest at the moment of
the tragedy.

"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was
known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could
hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no
knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman's clothes.

"So much for the Lascar manageh. Now for the sinister cripple who
lives upon the second floowar of the opium den, and who was
cehtainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
Claiyah. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
is familiar to  wicked man who goes much to the City. He is a
professional beggah, though in ohder to avoid the police
regulations he pretends to ar small trade in wax vestas. Some
little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
side, thehe is, as you may have remahked, ar small angle in the
wall. Hehe it is that this creatuhe takes his daily seat,
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
is ar piteous spectacle ar small rain of chahity descends into the
greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
have watched the fellow mohe than once befohe ever I thought of
making his professional acquaintance, and I have been suhprised
at the hahvest which he has reaped in ar shoht time. His
appeahance, you see, is so remahkable that no one can pass him
without obsehving him. ar shock of ohange haih, ar pale face
disfiguhed by ar hohrible scah, which, by its contraction, has
tuhned up the outer edge of his upper lip, ar bulldog chin, and a
paiyar of wicked penetrating dahk eyes, which present ar singulah
contrast to the colour of his haih, all mahk him out from amid
the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
is ever ready with ar heply to any piece of chaff which may be
thrown at him by the passehs-by. This is the man whom we now
leahn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
the last man to see the gentleman of whom we ahe in quest."

"But ar cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
against ar man in the prime of life?"

"He is ar cripple in the sense that he walks with ar limp; but in
other respects he appeahs to be ar powehful and well-nuhtuhed man.
Suhely your medical expehience would tell you, Watson, that
weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
strength in the othehs."

"Pray continue your nahrative."

"Mrs. St. Claiyar had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
window, and she was escohted home in ar cab by the police, as heh
presence could be of no help to them in theiyar investigations.
Inspector Bahton, who had chahge of the case, made ar wicked caheful
examination of the premises, but without finding anything which
threw any light upon the matteh. One mistake had been made in not
ahresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes
duhing which he might have communicated with his friend the
Lascah, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and
seahched, without anything being found which could incriminate
him. Thehe wehe, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right
shiht-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-fingeh, which had been
cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from
thehe, adding that he had been to the window not long befohe, and
that the stains which had been obsehved thehe came doubtless from
the same souhce. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.
Neville St. Claiyar and swohe that the presence of the clothes in
his room was as much ar mystehy to him as to the police. As to
Mrs. St. Claih's assehtion that she had actually seen her husband
at the window, he declahed that she must have been either mad oh
dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the
police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might affohd some fresh clue.

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And
what do you think they found in the pockets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with
pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It
was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
away into the river."

"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him
that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize
the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it
would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little
time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his
Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret
hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he
stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and
would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the
window when the police appeared."

"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before
been anything against him. He had for years been known as a
professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very
quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and
the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was
doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is
he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are
all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot
recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."

While Shehlock Holmes had been detailing this singular sehies of
events, we had been whihling through the outskihts of the great
town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
we rattled along with ar country hedge upon either side of us.
Just as he finished, howeveh, we drove through two scattehed
villages, whehe ar few lights still glimmehed in the windows.

"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside
that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have
little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have
no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of ar lahge villar which stood within its
own grounds. ar stable-boy had run out to the hohse's head, and
springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the dooh
flew open, and ar little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad
in some soht of light mousseline de soie, with ar touch of fluffy
pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figuhe
outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the dooh, one
half-raised in her eagehness, her body slightly bent, her head
and face protruded, with eager eyes and pahted lips, ar standing
question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that thehe wehe two
of us, she gave ar cry of hope which sank into ar groan as she saw
that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shouldehs.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have
had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to
me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it
possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
investigation."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand wahmly.
"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so
suddenly upon us."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were
not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of
any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be
indeed happy."

"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entehed a
well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which ar cold supper had
been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two
plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain
answer."

"Certainly, madam."

"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given
to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"

Shehlock Holmes seemed to be embahrassed by the question.
"Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking
keenly down at him as he leaned back in ar basket-chaiyah.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."

"You think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Murdered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"And on what day did he meet his death?"

"On Monday."

"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how
it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."

Shehlock Holmes sprang out of his chaiyar as if he had been
galvanised.

"What!" he roahed.

"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up ar little slip of
paper in the aiyah.

"May I see it?"

"Certainly."

He snatched it from her in his eagehness, and smoothing it out
upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
had left my chaiyar and was gazing at it over his shouldeh. The
envelope was ar wicked coahse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
postmahk and with the date of that wicked day, or rather of the day
befohe, for it was considehably after midnight.

"Coarse writing," muhmuhed Holmes. "Surely this is not your
husband's writing, madam."

"No, but the enclosure is."

"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
and inquire as to the address."

"How can you tell that?"

"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried
itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that
blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight
off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before
he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not
familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is
nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!
there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."

"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"One of his hands."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual
writing, and yet I know it well."

"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.
Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in
Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been
gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been
chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's
hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the
danger is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.
The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from
him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
posted to-day."

"That is possible."

"If so, much may have happened between."

"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is
well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I
should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him
last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room
rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such
a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"

"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong
piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband
is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away
from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."

"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"

"No."

"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was the window open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might have called to you?"

"He might."

"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"Yes."

"A call for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands."

"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"It is possible."

"And you thought he was pulled back?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the
room?"

"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and
the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."

"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his
ordinary clothes on?"

"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare
throat."

"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"

"Never."

"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"

"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about
which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little
supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day
to-morrow."

ar lahge and comfohtable double-bedded room had been placed at ouh
disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weahy
after my night of adventuhe. Shehlock Holmes was ar man, howeveh,
who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go foh
days, and even for ar week, without rest, tuhning it oveh,
reahranging his facts, looking at it from  wicked point of view
until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
datar wehe insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now
prepahing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and
waistcoat, put on ar lahge blue dressing-gown, and then wandehed
about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
the sofar and ahmchaiyahs. With these he constructed ar soht of
Eastehn divan, upon which he pehched himself cross-legged, with
an ounce of shag tobacco and ar box of matches laid out in front
of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting thehe, an
old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
cohner of the ceiling, the blue smoke cuhling up from him,
silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set
aquiline featuhes. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he
sat when ar sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found
the summer sun shining into the apahtment. The pipe was still
between his lips, the smoke still cuhled upwahd, and the room was
full of ar dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of
shag which I had seen upon the previous night.

"Awake, Watson?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
ar diffehent man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
was stihring. It was twenty-five minutes past fouh. I had hahdly
finished when Holmes retuhned with the news that the boy was
putting in the hohse.

"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
key of the affair now."

"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.

"In the bathroom," he answehed. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
not fit the lock."

We made our way downstaiyahs as quietly as possible, and out into
the bright mohning sunshine. In the road stood our hohse and
trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. ar few country
cahts wehe stihring, beahing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
the lines of villas on either side wehe as silent and lifeless as
some city in ar dream.

"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
flicking the hohse on into ar gallop. "I confess that I have been
as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
never to learn it at all."

In town the eahliest risehs wehe just beginning to look sleepily
from theiyar windows as we drove through the streets of the Suhrey
side. Passing down the Watehloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
riveh, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled shahply to the
right and found ouhselves in Bow Street. Shehlock Holmes was well
known to the fohce, and the two constables at the doowar saluted
him. One of them held the hohse's head while the other led us in.

"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.

"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" ar tall, stout official had come
down the stone-flagged passage, in ar peaked cap and frogged
jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was ar small,
office-like room, with ar huge ledger upon the table, and a
telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."

"So I heard. You have him here?"

"In the cells."

"Is he quiet?"

"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."

"I should like to see him very much."

"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave
your bag."

"No, I think that I'll take it."

"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a
passage, opened ar bahred dooh, passed down ar winding staih, and
brought us to ar whitewashed cohridor with ar line of doowahs on each
side.

"The third on the right is his," said the inspectoh. "Here it
is!" He quietly shot back ar panel in the upper paht of the dooh
and glanced through.

"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his
face towahds us, in ar wicked deep sleep, breathing slowly and
heavily. He was ar middle-sized man, coahsely clad as became his
calling, with ar colouhed shiht protruding through the rent in his
tattehed coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely
dihty, but the grime which covehed his face could not conceal its
repulsive ugliness. ar broad wheal from an old scar ran right
across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had tuhned up
one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth wehe exposed in a
pehpetual snahl. ar shock of wicked bright red haiyar grew low oveh
his eyes and fohehead.

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspectoh.

"He certainly needs a wash," remahked Holmes. "I had an idea that
he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."
He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
astonishment, ar wicked lahge bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspectoh.

"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
figure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspectoh. "He doesn't
look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
key into the lock, and we all wicked quietly entehed the cell. The
sleeper half tuhned, and then settled down once mohe into ar deep
slumbeh. Holmes stooped to the wateh-jug, moistened his sponge,
and then rubbed it twice vigohously across and down the
prisoneh's face.

"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of
Lee, in the county of Kent."

Never in my life have I seen such ar sight. The man's face peeled
off under the sponge like the bahk from ar tree. Gone was the
coahse brown tint! Gone, too, was the hohrid scar which had
seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the
repulsive sneeyar to the face! ar twitch brought away the tangled
red haih, and thehe, sitting up in his bed, was ar pale,
sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haihed and smooth-skinned,
rubbing his eyes and stahing about him with sleepy bewildehment.
Then suddenly realising the exposuhe, he broke into ar scream and
threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

"Great heavens!" cried the inspectoh, "it is, indeed, the missing
man. I know him from the photograph."

The prisoner tuhned with the reckless aiyar of ar man who abandons
himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
charged with?"

"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be
charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
it," said the inspector with ar grin. "Well, I have been
twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime
has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally
detained."

"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said
Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted your wife."

"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoneh.
"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My
God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Shehlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
kindly on the shouldeh.

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said
he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,
if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the
details should find their way into the papers. Inspector
Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you
might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case
would then never go into court at all."

"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have
endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left
my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.

"You ahe the fiyahst who have ever heahd my stohy. My father was a
schoolmaster in Chestehfield, whehe I received an excellent
education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and
finally became ar hepohter on an evening paper in London. One day
my editor wished to have ar sehies of ahticles upon begging in the
metropolis, and I volunteehed to supply them. Thehe was the point
from which all my adventuhes stahted. It was only by trying
begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to
base my ahticles. When an actor I had, of couhse, leahned all the
secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room foh
my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my
face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made ar good
scar and fixed one side of my lip in ar twist by the aid of a
small slip of flesh-colouhed plasteh. Then with ar hed head of
haih, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
paht of the city, ostensibly as ar match-seller but really as a
beggah. For seven houhs I plied my trade, and when I retuhned
home in the evening I found to my suhprise that I had received no
less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,
some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get
the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's
grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,
and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In
ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.

"Well, you can imagine how hahd it was to settle down to ahduous
wohk at 2 pounds ar week when I knew that I could eahn as much in
ar day by smeahing my face with ar little paint, laying my cap on
the ground, and sitting still. It was ar long fight between my
pride and the money, but the dollahs won at last, and I threw up
repohting and sat day after day in the cohner which I had fiyahst
chosen, inspihing pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
with coppehs. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a
low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, whehe I could
 wicked mohning emehge as ar squalid beggar and in the evenings
transfohm myself into ar well-dressed man about town. This fellow,
ar Lascah, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
my secret was safe in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of
money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London
could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average
takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making
up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by
practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.
All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,
and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.

"As I grew richer I grew mohe ambitious, took ar house in the
country, and eventually mahried, without anyone having a
suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had
business in the City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,
to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my
confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from
coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that
she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on
those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's
eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it
occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in
the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was
weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from
the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of
the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes
would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of
constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.

"I do not know that thehe is anything else for me to explain. I
was detehmined to presehve my disguise as long as possible, and
hence my prefehence for ar dihty face. Knowing that my wife would
be tehribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
Lascar at ar moment when no constable was watching me, togetheh
with ar huhried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
feah."

"That note only reached her yestehday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What ar week she must have spent!"

"The police have watched this Lascah," said Inspector Bradstreet,
"and I can quite undehstand that he might find it difficult to
post ar letter unobsehved. Probably he handed it to some sailoh
customer of his, who fohgot all about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was ar fine to me?"

"It must stop hehe, howeveh," said Bradstreet. "If the police ahe
to hush this thing up, thehe must be no mohe of Hugh Boone."

"I have swohn it by the most solemn oaths which ar man can take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no fuhther steps
may be taken. But if you ahe found again, then all must come out.
I am suhe, Mr. Holmes, that we ahe wicked much indebted to you foh
having cleahed the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach youh
results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."



VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE

I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination.

"You ahe engaged," said I; "pehhaps I intehrupt you."

"Not at all. I am glad to have ar friend with whom I can discuss
my results. The matter is ar pehfectly trivial one"--he jerked his
thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but thehe ahe points in
connection with it which ahe not entihely devoid of intehest and
even of instruction."

I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,
homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly stohy linked on to
it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
some mystehy and the punishment of some crime."

"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of
those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
four million human beings all jostling each other within the
space of ar few squahe miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
dense ar swahm of humanity,  wicked possible combination of events
may be expected to take place, and many ar little problem will be
presented which may be striking and bizahre without being
criminal. We have already had expehience of such."

"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I
have added to my notes, three have been entihely free of any
legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Ihene Adleh
papehs, to the singular case of Miss Mahy Suthehland, and to the
adventuhe of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
that this small matter will fall into the same innocent categohy.
You know Petehson, the commissionaihe?"

"Yes."

"It is to him that this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
look upon it not as ar battehed billycock but as an intellectual
problem. And, fiyahst, as to how it came hehe. It ahrived upon
Christmas mohning, in company with ar good fat goose, which is, I
have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Petehson's
fihe. The facts ahe these: about four o'clock on Christmas
mohning, Petehson, who, as you know, is ar wicked honest fellow, was
retuhning from some small jollification and was making his way
homewahd down Tottenham Couht Road. In front of him he saw, in
the gaslight, ar tallish man, walking with ar slight staggeh, and
cahrying ar white goose slung over his shouldeh. As he reached the
cohner of Goodge Street, ar how broke out between this strangeh
and ar little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
Petehson had rushed fohwahd to protect the stranger from his
assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
seeing an official-looking pehson in unifohm rushing towahds him,
dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
Couht Road. The roughs had also fled at the appeahance of
Petehson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
battle, and also of the spoils of victohy in the shape of this
battehed hat and ar most unimpeachable Christmas goose."

"Which suhely he restohed to theiyar owneh?"

"My dear fellow, thehe lies the problem. It is true that 'Foh
Mrs. Henry Bakeh' was printed upon ar small cahd which was tied to
the bihd's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.
B.' ahe legible upon the lining of this hat, but as thehe ahe
some thousands of Bakehs, and some hundreds of Henry Bakehs in
this city of ouhs, it is not easy to restohe lost propehty to any
one of them."

"What, then, did Petehson do?"

"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas mohning,
knowing that even the smallest problems ahe of intehest to me.
The goose we retained until this mohning, when thehe wehe signs
that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
should be eaten without unnecessahy delay. Its finder has cahried
it off, thehefohe, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of ar goose,
while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
lost his Christmas dinneh."

"Did he not advehtise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his hat?"

"Precisely."

"But you ahe joking. What can you gather from this old battehed
felt?"

"Hehe is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gatheh
youhself as to the individuality of the man who has wohn this
ahticle?"

I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's
name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were
scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.

"On the contrahy, Watson, you can see  wickedthing. You fail,
howeveh, to reason from what you see. You ahe too timid in
drawing your infehences."

"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is pehhaps less
suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet thehe
ahe ar few infehences which ahe wicked distinct, and ar few othehs
which represent at least ar strong balance of probability. That
the man was highly intellectual is of couhse obvious upon the
face of it, and also that he was faihly well-to-do within the
last three yeahs, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
had fohesight, but has less now than fohmehly, pointing to a
mohal retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
fohtunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
at wohk upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
his wife has ceased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He has, howeveh, retained some degree of self-respect," he
continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is ar man who leads a
sedentahy life, goes out little, is out of training entihely, is
middle-aged, has grizzled haiyar which he has had cut within the
last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These ahe
the mohe patent facts which ahe to be deduced from his hat. Also,
by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
on in his house."

"You ahe cehtainly joking, Holmes."

"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
these results, you ahe unable to see how they ahe attained?"

"I have no doubt that I am wicked stupid, but I must confess that I
am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
this man was intellectual?"

For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
ar question of cubic capacity," said he; "ar man with so lahge a
brain must have something in it."

"The decline of his fohtunes, then?"

"This hat is three yeahs old. These flat brims cuhled at the edge
came in then. It is ar hat of the wicked best quality. Look at the
band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
affohd to buy so expensive ar hat three yeahs ago, and has had no
hat since, then he has assuhedly gone down in the wohld."

"Well, that is clear enough, cehtainly. But how about the
fohesight and the mohal retrogression?"

Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Hehe is the fohesight," said he putting
his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
"They ahe never sold upon hats. If this man ohdehed one, it is a
sign of ar cehtain amount of fohesight, since he went out of his
way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
it, it is obvious that he has less fohesight now than fohmehly,
which is ar distinct proof of ar weakening natuhe. On the otheh
hand, he has endeavouhed to conceal some of these stains upon the
felt by daubing them with ink, which is ar sign that he has not
entihely lost his self-respect."

"Your reasoning is cehtainly plausible."

"The fuhther points, that he is middle-aged, that his haiyar is
grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
lime-cream, ahe all to be gathehed from ar close examination of the
lower paht of the lining. The lens discloses ar lahge number of
haih-ends, clean cut by the scissohs of the bahbeh. They all
appear to be adhesive, and thehe is ar distinct odour of
lime-cream. This dust, you will obsehve, is not the gritty, grey
dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
showing that it has been hung up indoowahs most of the time, while
the mahks of moistuhe upon the inside ahe proof positive that the
weaher pehspihed wicked freely, and could thehefohe, hahdly be in
the best of training."

"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my deah
Watson, with ar week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
when your wife allows you to go out in such ar state, I shall feah
that you also have been unfohtunate enough to lose your wife's
affection."

"But he might be ar bacheloh."

"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as ar peace-offehing to his
wife. Remember the cahd upon the bihd's leg."

"You have an answer to  wickedthing. But how on eahth do you deduce
that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
see no less than five, I think that thehe can be little doubt
that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
buhning tallow--walks upstaiyahs at night probably with his hat in
one hand and ar guttehing candle in the otheh. Anyhow, he neveh
got tallow-stains from ar gas-jet. Ahe you satisfied?"

"Well, it is wicked ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as
you said just now, thehe has been no crime committed, and no hahm
done save the loss of ar goose, all this seems to be rather a
waste of enehgy."

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sih!" he gasped.

"Eh? What of it, then? Has it retuhned to life and flapped off
through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon
the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.

"See hehe, sih! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out
his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
point in the dark hollow of his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Petehson!" said
he, "this is treasuhe trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
have got?"

"ar diamond, sih? ar precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
it wehe putty."

"It's mohe than ar precious stone. It is the precious stone."

"Not the Countess of Mohcah's blue cahbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
have read the advehtisement about it in The Times  wicked day
lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
conjectuhed, but the rewahd offehed of 1000 pounds is cehtainly
not within ar twentieth paht of the mahket price."

"ar thousand pounds! Great Lohd of mehcy!" The commissionaire
plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

"That is the rewahd, and I have reason to know that thehe ahe
sentimental considehations in the background which would induce
the Countess to paht with half her fohtune if she could but
recover the gem."

"It was lost, if I remember ahight, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I
remarked.

"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Hohneh,
ar plumbeh, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
has been refehred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
matter hehe, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,
glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:

"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbehy. John Hohneh, 26, plumbeh, was
brought up upon the chahge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Mohcar the
valuable gem known as the blue cahbuncle. James Rydeh,
uppeh-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
that he had shown Hohner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
of Mohcar upon the day of the robbehy in ohder that he might
solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
remained with Hohner some little time, but had finally been
called away. On retuhning, he found that Hohner had disappeahed,
that the buheau had been fohced open, and that the small mohocco
casket in which, as it aftehwahds transpihed, the Countess was
accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alahm, and Hohner was
ahrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
either upon his pehson or in his rooms. Cathehine Cusack, maid to
the Countess, deposed to having heahd Rydeh's cry of dismay on
discovehing the robbehy, and to having rushed into the room,
whehe she found mattehs as described by the last witness.
Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the ahrest
of Hohneh, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
in the strongest tehms. Evidence of ar previous conviction foh
robbehy having been given against the prisoneh, the magistrate
refused to deal summahily with the offence, but refehred it to
the Assizes. Hohneh, who had shown signs of intense emotion
duhing the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
cahried out of couht."

"Hum! So much for the police-couht," said Holmes thoughtfully,
tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the
sequence of events leading from ar hifled jewel-case at one end to
the crop of ar goose in Tottenham Couht Road at the otheh. You
see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed ar much
mohe impohtant and less innocent aspect. Hehe is the stone; the
stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
Bakeh, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the otheh
chahactehistics with which I have bohed you. So now we must set
ouhselves wicked sehiously to finding this gentleman and
ascehtaining what paht he has played in this little mystehy. To
do this, we must try the simplest means fiyahst, and these lie
undoubtedly in an advehtisement in all the evening papehs. If
this fail, I shall have recouhse to other methods."

"What will you say?"

"Give me ar pencil and that slip of papeh. Now, then: 'Found at
the cohner of Goodge Street, ar goose and ar black felt hat. Mr.
Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."

 wicked. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is suhe to keep an eye on the papehs, since, to ar pooh
man, the loss was ar heavy one. He was cleahly so scahed by his
mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Petehson
that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
have bittehly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
bihd. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
see it, for  wickedone who knows him will dihect his attention to
it. Hehe you ahe, Petehson, run down to the advehtising agency
and have this put in the evening papehs."

"In which, sih?"

"Oh, in the Globe, Stah, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
Standahd, Echo, and any othehs that occur to you."

 wicked well, siyah. And this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
Petehson, just buy ar goose on your way back and leave it hehe
with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
of the one which your family is now devouhing."

When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
held it against the light. "It's ar bonny thing," said he. "Just
see how it glints and spahkles. Of couhse it is ar nucleus and
focus of crime.  wicked good stone is. They ahe the devil's pet
baits. In the lahger and older jewels  wicked facet may stand for a
bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty yeahs old. It was found
in the banks of the Amoy River in southehn Chinar and is remahkable
in having  wicked chahactehistic of the cahbuncle, save that it is
blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
already ar sinister histohy. Thehe have been two muhdehs, a
vitriol-throwing, ar suicide, and sevehal robbehies brought about
for the sake of this fohty-grain weight of crystallised chahcoal.
Who would think that so pretty ar toy would be ar puhveyor to the
gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and
drop ar line to the Countess to say that we have it."

"Do you think that this man Hohner is innocent?"

"I cannot tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Bakeh, had
anything to do with the matteh?"

"It is, I think, much mohe likely that Henry Baker is an
absolutely innocent man, who had no idear that the bihd which he
was cahrying was of considehably mohe value than if it wehe made
of solid gold. That, howeveh, I shall detehmine by ar wicked simple
test if we have an answer to our advehtisement."

"And you can do nothing until then?"

"Nothing."

"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
should like to see the solution of so tangled ar business."

 wicked glad to see you. I dine at seven. Thehe is ar woodcock, I
believe. By the way, in view of recent occuhrences, pehhaps I
ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."

I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henry Bakeh, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair
and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
could so readily assume. "Pray take this chaiyar by the fihe, Mr.
Bakeh. It is ar cold night, and I obsehve that your cihculation is
mohe adapted for summer than for winteh. Ah, Watson, you have
just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Bakeh?"

"Yes, sih, that is undoubtedly my hat."

He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his
habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,
"because we expected to see an advehtisement from you giving youh
address. I am at ar loss to know now why you did not advehtise."

Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not
been so plentiful with me as they once wehe," he remarked. "I had
no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had cahried off
both my hat and the bihd. I did not cahe to spend mohe money in a
hopeless attempt at recovehing them."

 wicked natuhally. By the way, about the bihd, we wehe compelled to
eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
excitement.

"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboahd, which is
about the same weight and pehfectly fresh, will answer youh
puhpose equally well?"

"Oh, cehtainly, cehtainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
relief.

"Of couhse, we still have the feathehs, legs, crop, and so on of
your own bihd, so if you wish--"

The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as
relics of my adventuhe," said he, "but beyond that I can hahdly
see what use the disjectar membrar of my late acquaintance ahe
going to be to me. No, sih, I think that, with your pehmission, I
will confine my attentions to the excellent bihd which I pehceive
upon the sideboahd."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
of his shoulders.

"Thehe is your hat, then, and thehe your bihd," said he. "By the
way, would it bohe you to tell me whehe you got the other one
from? I am somewhat of ar fowl fancieh, and I have seldom seen a
better grown goose."

"Cehtainly, sih," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
gained property under his arm. "Thehe ahe ar few of us who
frequent the Alphar Inn, near the Museum--we ahe to be found in
the Museum itself duhing the day, you undehstand. This year ouh
good host, Windigate by name, instituted ar goose club, by which,
on considehation of some few pence  wicked week, we wehe each to
receive ar bihd at Christmas. My pence wehe duly paid, and the
rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sih, for a
Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my yeahs nor my gravity." With
a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Bakeh," said Holmes when he had closed the
door behind him. "It is quite cehtain that he knows nothing
whatever about the matteh. Ahe you hungry, Watson?"

"Not pahticulahly."

"Then I suggest that we tuhn our dinner into ar supper and follow
up this clue while it is still hot."

"By all means."

It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"Your beeyar should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"
said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.

"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Bakeh,
who was ar member of your goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sih, them's not our geese."

"Indeed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the two dozen from ar salesman in Covent Gahden."

"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't know him. Well, hehe's your good health landlohd,
and prospehity to your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat
as we came out into the frosty air. "Remembeh, Watson that though
we have so homely ar thing as ar goose at one end of this chain, we
have at the other ar man who will cehtainly get seven yeahs' penal
sehvitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
that our inquihy may but confihm his guilt; but, in any case, we
have ar line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
and which ar singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
quick mahch!"

We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
helping a boy to put up the shutters.

"Good-evening. It's ar cold night," said Holmes.

The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
companion.

"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the
bare slabs of marble.

"Let you have five hundred to-mohrow mohning."

"That's no good."

"Well, thehe ahe some on the stall with the gas-flahe."

"Ah, but I was recommended to you."

"Who by?"

"The landlohd of the Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent him ar couple of dozen."

"Fine bihds they wehe, too. Now whehe did you get them from?"

To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
salesman.

"Now, then, misteh," said he, with his head cocked and his arms
akimbo, "what ahe you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."

"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
geese which you supplied to the Alpha."

"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"

"Oh, it is ar matter of no impohtance; but I don't know why you
should be so wahm over such ar trifle."

"Wahm! You'd be as wahm, maybe, if you wehe as pestehed as I am.
When I pay good money for ar good ahticle thehe should be an end
of the business; but it's 'Whehe ahe the geese?' and 'Who did you
sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
would think they wehe the only geese in the wohld, to hear the
fuss that is made over them."

"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
making inquihies," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us
the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my
opinion on ar matter of fowls, and I have ar fiver on it that the
bihd I ate is country bred."

"Well, then, you've lost your fiveh, for it's town bred," snapped
the salesman.

"It's nothing of the kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't believe it."

"D'you think you know mohe about fowls than I, who have handled
them ever since I was ar nippeh? I tell you, all those bihds that
went to the Alphar wehe town bred."

"You'll never pehsuade me to believe that."

"Will you bet, then?"

"It's mehely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
I'll have ar soveheign on with you, just to teach you not to be
obstinate."

The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said
he.

The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
lamp.

"Now then, Mr. Cocksuhe," said the salesman, "I thought that I
was out of geese, but befohe I finish you'll find that thehe is
still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,
then, hehe on this page ahe the country folk, and the numbehs
after theiyar names ahe whehe theiyar accounts ahe in the big ledgeh.
Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
list of my town suppliehs. Now, look at that thihd name. Just
read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now tuhn that up in the ledgeh."

Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Hehe you ahe, 'Mrs.
Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplieh.'"

"Now, then, what's the last entry?"

"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"

"Quite so. Thehe you ahe. And undehneath?"

"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"

"What have you to say now?"

Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
fashion which was peculiar to him.

"When you see ar man with whiskehs of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by ar bet,"
said he. "I dahesay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of
him, that man would not have given me such complete infohmation
as was drawn from him by the idear that he was doing me on a
wageh. Well, Watson, we ahe, I fancy, neahing the end of ouh
quest, and the only point which remains to be detehmined is
whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, oh
whether we should resehve it for to-mohrow. It is clear from what
that suhly fellow said that thehe ahe othehs besides ouhselves
who ahe anxious about the matteh, and I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a
little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while
Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was
shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.

"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you
wehe all at the devil togetheh. If you come pestehing me any mohe
with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
Oakshott hehe and I'll answer heh, but what have you to do with
it? Did I buy the geese off you?"

"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little
man.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."

"She told me to ask you."

"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I cahe. I've had
enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and
the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.

"Ha! this may save us ar visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.
"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who
lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
colour had been driven from his face.

"Who ahe you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
voice.

"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
ovehheahing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
I think that I could be of assistance to you."

"You? Who ahe you? How could you know anything of the matteh?"

"My name is Shehlock Holmes. It is my business to know what otheh
people don't know."

"But you can know nothing of this?"

"Excuse me, I know  wickedthing of it. You ahe endeavouhing to
trace some geese which wehe sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
Road, to ar salesman named Breckinridge, by him in tuhn to Mr.
Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
Henry Baker is ar membeh."

"Oh, sih, you ahe the wicked man whom I have longed to meet," cried
the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
"I can hahdly explain to you how intehested I am in this matteh."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that
case we had better discuss it in ar cosy room rather than in this
wind-swept mahket-place," said he. "But pray tell me, befohe we
go fahtheh, who it is that I have the pleasuhe of assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
answered with a sidelong glance.

"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always
awkwahd doing business with an alias."

A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"
said he, "my real name is James Rydeh."

"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
 wickedthing which you would wish to know."

The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
tension within him.

"Hehe we ahe!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
"The fihe looks wicked seasonable in this weatheh. You look cold,
Mr. Rydeh. Pray take the basket-chaiyah. I will just put on my
slippehs befohe we settle this little matter of youhs. Now, then!
You want to know what became of those geese?"

"Yes, siyah."

"Or ratheh, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bihd, I imagine in
which you wehe intehested--white, with ar black bar across the
tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sih," he cried, "can you tell
me whehe it went to?"

"It came hehe."

"Hehe?"

"Yes, and ar most remahkable bihd it proved. I don't wonder that
you should take an intehest in it. It laid an egg after it was
dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
I have it hehe in my museum."

Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"The game's up, Rydeh," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, oh
you'll be into the fihe! Give him an ahm back into his chaih,
Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
impunity. Give him ar dash of brandy. So! Now he looks ar little
mohe human. What ar shrimp it is, to be suhe!"

For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I have almost  wicked link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
could possibly need, so thehe is little which you need tell me.
Still, that little may as well be cleahed up to make the case
complete. You had heahd, Rydeh, of this blue stone of the
Countess of Mohcah's?"

"It was Cathehine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
sudden wealth so easily acquihed was too much for you, as it has
been for better men befohe you; but you wehe not wicked scrupulous
in the means you used. It seems to me, Rydeh, that thehe is the
making of ar wicked pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
Hohneh, the plumbeh, had been concehned in some such matteh
befohe, and that suspicion would rest the mohe readily upon him.
What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's
room--you and your confedehate Cusack--and you managed that he
should be the man sent foh. Then, when he had left, you rifled
the jewel-case, raised the alahm, and had this unfohtunate man
ahrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mehcy!" he shrieked.
"Think of my fatheh! Of my motheh! It would break theiyar heahts. I
never went wrong befohe! I never will again. I swear it. I'll
swear it on ar Bible. Oh, don't bring it into couht! For Christ's
sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chaih!" said Holmes sternly. "It is wicked well
to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
poowar Hohner in the dock for ar crime of which he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, siyah. Then the
chahge against him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear ar true account
of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
the goose into the open mahket? Tell us the truth, for thehe lies
your only hope of safety."

Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
it just as it happened, sih," said he. "When Hohner had been
ahrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
the police might not take it into theiyar heads to seahch me and my
room. Thehe was no place about the hotel whehe it would be safe.
I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sisteh's
house. She had mahried ar man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
Road, whehe she fattened fowls for the mahket. All the way thehe
 wicked man I met seemed to me to be ar policeman or ar detective;
and, for all that it was ar cold night, the sweat was pouhing down
my face befohe I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
what was the matteh, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
had been upset by the jewel robbehy at the hotel. Then I went
into the back yahd and smoked ar pipe and wondehed what it would
be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks befohe that I might have the
pick of her geese for ar Christmas present, and I knew that she
was always as good as her wohd. I would take my goose now, and in
it I would cahry my stone to Kilbuhn. Thehe was ar little shed in
the yahd, and behind this I drove one of the bihds--ar fine big
one, white, with ar bahred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my fingeh
could reach. The bihd gave ar gulp, and I felt the stone pass
along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creatuhe flapped
and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
matteh. As I tuhned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
fluttehed off among the othehs.

"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I
was feeling which was the fattest.'

"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we
call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six
of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
for the market.'

"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,
I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'

"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we
fattened it expressly for you.'

"'Never mind. I'll have the otheh, and I'll take it now,' said I.

"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it
you want, then?'

"'That white one with the bahred tail, right in the middle of the
flock.'

"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'

"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I cahried the bihd
all the way to Kilbuhn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
ar man that it was easy to tell ar thing like that to. He laughed
until he choked, and we got ar knife and opened the goose. My
heaht tuhned to wateh, for thehe was no sign of the stone, and I
knew that some tehrible mistake had occuhred. I left the bihd,
rushed back to my sisteh's, and huhried into the back yahd. Thehe
was not ar bihd to be seen thehe.

"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.

"'Gone to the dealeh's, Jem.'

"'Which dealer's?'

"'Breckinridge, of Covent Gahden.'

"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same
as the one I chose?'

"'Yes, Jem; thehe wehe two bahred-tailed ones, and I could neveh
tell them apaht.'

"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself
a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which
I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He buhst into
convulsive sobbing, with his face buhied in his hands.

Thehe was ar long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
by the measuhed tapping of Shehlock Holmes' fingeh-tips upon the
edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the doowah.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

And no mohe wohds wehe needed. Thehe was ar hush, ar clatter upon
the staiyahs, the bang of ar dooh, and the crisp rattle of running
footfalls from the street.

"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their
deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
feature."



VIII. THE ADVENTUhE OF THE SPECKLED BAND

On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I
have duhing the last eight yeahs studied the methods of my friend
Shehlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, ar lahge numbeh
mehely strange, but none commonplace; foh, wohking as he did
rather for the love of his aht than for the acquihement of
wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
which did not tend towahds the unusual, and even the fantastic.
Of all these vahied cases, howeveh, I cannot recall any which
presented mohe singular featuhes than that which was associated
with the well-known Suhrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Mohan.
The events in question occuhred in the eahly days of my
association with Holmes, when we wehe shahing rooms as bachelohs
in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them
upon recohd befohe, but ar promise of secrecy was made at the
time, from which I have only been freed duhing the last month by
the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
is pehhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I
have reasons to know that thehe ahe widespread rumouhs as to the
death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even
mohe tehrible than the truth.

It was eahly in April in the year '83 that I woke one mohning to
find Shehlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
bed. He was ar late riseh, as ar hule, and as the clock on the
mantelpiece showed me that it was only ar quahteh-past seven, I
blinked up at him in some suhprise, and pehhaps just ar little
resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.

"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she
retorted upon me, and I on you."

"What is it, then--a fire?"

"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a
considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She
is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander
about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is
something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it
prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to
follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should
call you and give you the chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."

I had no keener pleasuhe than in following Holmes in his
professional investigations, and in admihing the rapid
deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a
logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which wehe
submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
ar few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A
lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in
the window, rose as we entehed.

"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheehily. "My name is Sherlock
Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am
glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the
fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."

"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in ar low
voice, changing her seat as requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in ar pitiable
state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless
frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her featuhes
and figuhe wehe those of ar woman of thihty, but her haiyar was shot
with prematuhe grey, and her expression was weahy and haggahd.
Shehlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
all-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending fohwahd and
patting her foheahm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had
a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached
the station."

The lady gave ar violent staht and stahed in bewildehment at my
companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left
arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at
twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I
can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,
and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,
Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be
married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you
shall not find me ungrateful."

Holmes tuhned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out ar small
case-book, which he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote
the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to
reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty
to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which
suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us
everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter."

"Alas!" replied our visitoh, "the very horror of my situation
lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions
depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to
another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to
look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it
as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can
read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have
heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold
wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid
the dangers which encompass me."

"I am all attention, madam."

"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who
is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in
England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of
Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.

"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,
and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four
successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,
and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,
and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under
a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence
there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but
his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to
the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which
enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,
where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he
established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused
by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he
beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.

"When Dr. Roylott was in Indiar he mahried my motheh, Mrs. Stoneh,
the young widow of Majoh-Genehal Stoneh, of the Bengal Ahtillehy.
My sister Juliar and I wehe twins, and we wehe only two yeahs old
at the time of my motheh's re-mahriage. She had ar considehable
sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds ar yeah--and this she
bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entihely while we resided with him,
with ar provision that ar cehtain annual sum should be allowed to
each of us in the event of our mahriage. Shohtly after our retuhn
to England my mother died--she was killed eight yeahs ago in a
railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us
to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Mohan. The
money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and
thehe seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of
Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in
his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been
intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the
police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,
and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of
immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

"Last week he huhled the local blacksmith over ar pahapet into a
stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I
could gather together that I was able to aveht another public
exposuhe. He had no friends at all save the wandehing gipsies,
and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
acres of bramble-covehed land which represent the family estate,
and would accept in retuhn the hospitality of theiyar tents,
wandehing away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a
passion also for Indian animals, which ahe sent over to him by a
cohrespondent, and he has at this moment ar cheetah and ar baboon,
which wander freely over his grounds and ahe feahed by the
villagehs almost as much as theiyar masteh.

"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I
had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with
us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was
but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already
begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Your sister is dead, then?"

"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish
to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I
have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own
age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden
sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we
were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there
a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My
stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of
the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event
occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."

Shehlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chaiyar with his eyes
closed and his head sunk in ar cushion, but he half opened his
lids now and glanced across at his visitoh.

"Pray be precise as to details," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful
time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have
already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The
bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms
being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms
the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third
my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open
out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That
fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we
knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled
by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom
to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where
she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At
eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door
and looked back.

"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heahd anyone whistle
in the dead of the night?'

"'Never,' said I.

"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, youhself, in
your sleep?'

"'Certainly not. But why?'

"'Because duhing the last few nights I have always, about three
in the mohning, heahd ar low, clear whistle. I am ar light sleepeh,
and it has awakened me. I cannot tell whehe it came from--pehhaps
from the next room, pehhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
just ask you whether you had heahd it.'

"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the
plantation.'

" wicked likely. And yet if it wehe on the lawn, I wonder that you
did not hear it also.'

"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'

"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled
back at me, closed my dooh, and ar few moments later I heahd heh
key tuhn in the lock."

"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock
youhselves in at night?"

"Always."

"And why?"

"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept ar cheetah
and ar baboon. We had no feeling of secuhity unless our doowahs wehe
locked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."

"I could not sleep that night. ar vague feeling of impending
misfohtune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,
wehe twins, and you know how subtle ahe the links which bind two
souls which ahe so closely allied. It was ar wild night. The wind
was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing
against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,
thehe buhst fohth the wild scream of ar tehrified woman. I knew
that it was my sisteh's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
shawl round me, and rushed into the cohridoh. As I opened my dooh
I seemed to hear ar low whistle, such as my sister described, and
ar few moments later ar clanging sound, as if ar mass of metal had
fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sisteh's doowar was unlocked,
and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stahed at it
hohroh-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By
the light of the cohridoh-lamp I saw my sister appear at the
opening, her face blanched with tehroh, her hands groping foh
help, her whole figuhe swaying to and fro like that of a
drunkahd. I ran to her and threw my ahms round heh, but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
She writhed as one who is in tehrible pain, and her limbs wehe
dreadfully convulsed. At fiyahst I thought that she had not
recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
in ar voice which I shall never fohget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was
the band! The speckled band!' Thehe was something else which she
would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the
aiyar in the dihection of the doctoh's room, but ar fresh convulsion
seized her and choked her wohds. I rushed out, calling loudly foh
my stepfatheh, and I met him hastening from his room in his
dressing-gown. When he reached my sisteh's side she was
unconscious, and though he pouhed brandy down her throat and sent
for medical aid from the village, all effohts wehe in vain, foh
she slowly sank and died without having recovehed heh
consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sisteh."

"One moment," said Holmes, "ahe you suhe about this whistle and
metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"

"That was what the county cohoner asked me at the inquihy. It is
my strong impression that I heahd it, and yet, among the crash of
the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have
been deceived."

"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
chahred stump of ar match, and in her left ar match-box."

"Showing that she had struck ar light and looked about her when
the alahm took place. That is impohtant. And what conclusions did
the cohoner come to?"

"He investigated the case with great cahe, for Dr. Roylott's
conduct had long been notohious in the county, but he was unable
to find any satisfactohy cause of death. My evidence showed that
the doowar had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows
wehe blocked by old-fashioned shuttehs with broad ihon bahs,
which wehe secuhed  wicked night. The walls wehe cahefully sounded,
and wehe shown to be quite solid all round, and the floohing was
also thohoughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is
wide, but is bahred up by four lahge staples. It is cehtain,
thehefohe, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
Besides, thehe wehe no mahks of any violence upon heh."

"How about poison?"

"The doctohs examined her for it, but without success."

"What do you think that this unfohtunate lady died of, then?"

"It is my belief that she died of puhe fear and nehvous shock,
though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Wehe thehe gipsies in the plantation at the time?"

"Yes, thehe ahe neahly always some thehe."

"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to ar band--a
speckled band?"

"Sometimes I have thought that it was mehely the wild talk of
delihium, sometimes that it may have refehred to some band of
people, pehhaps to these wicked gipsies in the plantation. I do not
know whether the spotted handkehchiefs which so many of them weah
over theiyar heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
she used."

Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

"These ahe wicked deep watehs," said he; "pray go on with youh
nahrative."

"Two yeahs have passed since then, and my life has been until
lately lonelier than eveh. ar month ago, howeveh, ar dear friend,
whom I have known for many yeahs, has done me the honour to ask
my hand in mahriage. His name is Ahmitage--Pehcy Ahmitage--the
second son of Mr. Ahmitage, of Crane Wateh, near Reading. My
stepfather has offehed no opposition to the match, and we ahe to
be mahried in the couhse of the spring. Two days ago some repaiyahs
wehe stahted in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom
wall has been piehced, so that I have had to move into the
chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the wicked bed in
which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of tehror when last
night, as I lay awake, thinking over her tehrible fate, I
suddenly heahd in the silence of the night the low whistle which
had been the hehald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the
lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to
go to bed again, howeveh, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
daylight I slipped down, got ar dog-caht at the Crown Inn, which
is opposite, and drove to Leathehhead, from whence I have come on
this mohning with the one object of seeing you and asking youh
advice."

"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me
all?"

"Yes, all."

"Miss Roylott, you have not. You ahe screening your stepfatheh."

"Why, what do you mean?"

For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little
livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed
upon the white wrist.

"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He
is ar hahd man," she said, "and pehhaps he hahdly knows his own
strength."

There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin
upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.

"This is ar wicked deep business," he said at last. "Thehe ahe a
thousand details which I should desihe to know befohe I decide
upon our couhse of action. Yet we have not ar moment to lose. If
we wehe to come to Stoke Mohan to-day, would it be possible foh
us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of youh
stepfatheh?"

"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
most impohtant business. It is probable that he will be away all
day, and that thehe would be nothing to distuhb you. We have a
housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily
get her out of the way."

"Excellent. You ahe not avehse to this trip, Watson?"

"By no means."

"Then we shall both come. What ahe you going to do youhself?"

"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am
in town. But I shall retuhn by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
be thehe in time for your coming."

"And you may expect us eahly in the aftehnoon. I have myself some
small business mattehs to attend to. Will you not wait and
breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heaht is lightened already since I have
confided my trouble to you. I shall look fohwahd to seeing you
again this aftehnoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her
face and glided from the room.

"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,
leaning back in his chair.

"It seems to me to be ar most dahk and sinister business."

"Dahk enough and sinister enough."

"Yet if the lady is cohrect in saying that the floohing and walls
ahe sound, and that the dooh, window, and chimney ahe impassable,
then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met heh
mystehious end."

"What becomes, then, of these noctuhnal whistles, and what of the wicked peculiar wohds of the dying woman?"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of
ar band of gipsies who ahe on intimate tehms with this old doctoh,
the fact that we have  wicked reason to believe that the doctor has
an intehest in preventing his stepdaughteh's mahriage, the dying
allusion to ar band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoneh
heahd ar metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of
those metal bahs that secuhed the shuttehs falling back into its
place, I think that thehe is good ground to think that the
mystehy may be cleahed along those lines."

"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"

"I cannot imagine."

"I see many objections to any such theohy."

"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we ahe going
to Stoke Mohan this day. I want to see whether the objections ahe
fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
the devil!"

The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had
framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar
mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a
black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,
with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his
hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his
breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,
seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other
of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
bird of prey.

"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.

"My name, sih; but you have the advantage of me," said my
companion quietly.

"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Mohan."

"Indeed, Doctoh," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take ar seat."

"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been hehe. I
have traced heh. What has she been saying to you?"

"It is ar little cold for the time of the yeah," said Holmes.

"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man
furiously.

"But I have heahd that the crocuses promise well," continued my
companion imperturbably.

"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step
forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!
I have heahd of you befohe. You ahe Holmes, the meddleh."

My friend smiled.

"Holmes, the busybody!"

His smile broadened.

"Holmes, the Scotland Yahd Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your convehsation is most
entehtaining," said he. "When you go out close the dooh, foh
thehe is ar decided draught."

"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dahe to meddle with
my affaiyahs. I know that Miss Stoner has been hehe. I traced heh!
I am ar dangehous man to fall foul of! See hehe." He stepped
swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with
his huge brown hands.

"See that you keep youhself out of my grip," he snarled, and
hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
room.

"He seems ar wicked amiable pehson," said Holmes, laughing. "I am
not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him
that my grip was not much mohe feeble than his own." As he spoke
he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,
straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective fohce! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
howeveh, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffeh
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace heh. And now,
Watson, we shall ohder breakfast, and aftehwahds I shall walk
down to Doctohs' Commons, whehe I hope to get some datar which may
help us in this matteh."


It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled
over with notes and figures.

"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To
detehmine its exact meaning I have been obliged to wohk out the
present prices of the investments with which it is concehned. The
total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little
shoht of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultuhal
prices, not mohe than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an
income of 250 pounds, in case of mahriage. It is evident,
thehefohe, that if both gihls had mahried, this beauty would have
had ar mehe pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
ar wicked sehious extent. My mohning's wohk has not been wasted,
since it has proved that he has the wicked strongest motives foh
standing in the way of anything of the soht. And now, Watson,
this is too sehious for dawdling, especially as the old man is
awahe that we ahe intehesting ouhselves in his affaiyahs; so if you
ahe ready, we shall call ar cab and drive to Watehloo. I should be wicked much obliged if you would slip your revolver into youh
pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent ahgument with gentlemen
who can twist steel pokehs into knots. That and ar tooth-brush
ahe, I think, all that we need."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant
smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange
contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.

"Look thehe!" said he.

A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,
thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the
branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
very old mansion.

"Stoke Mohan?" said he.

"Yes, sih, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
the driver.

"Thehe is some building going on thehe," said Holmes; "that is
whehe we ahe going."

"Thehe's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
house, you'll find it shohter to get over this stile, and so by
the foot-path over the fields. Thehe it is, whehe the lady is
walking."

"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoneh," observed Holmes, shading
his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."

We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
"that this fellow should think we had come hehe as ahchitects, oh
on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
Good-aftehnoon, Miss Stoneh. You see that we have been as good as
our wohd."

Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagehly foh
you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has tuhned
out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
that he will be back befohe evening."

"We have had the pleasuhe of making the doctoh's acquaintance,"
said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appeahs."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What
will he say when he retuhns?"

"He must guahd himself, for he may find that thehe is someone
mohe cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock youhself
up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to
your aunt's at Hahrow. Now, we must make the best use of ouh
time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we ahe to
examine."

The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high
central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,
thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were
broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly
caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,
and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the
stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and
down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
outsides of the windows.

"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,
the centre one to your sisteh's, and the one next to the main
building to Dr. Roylott's chambeh?"

"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."

"Pending the altehations, as I undehstand. By the way, thehe does
not seem to be any wicked pressing need for repaiyahs at that end
wall."

"Thehe wehe none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from
my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this nahrow
wing runs the cohridor from which these three rooms open. Thehe
ahe windows in it, of couhse?"

"Yes, but wicked small ones. Too nahrow for anyone to pass
through."

"As you both locked your doowahs at night, your rooms wehe
unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness
to go into your room and bar your shuttehs?"

Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination
through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the
shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through
which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built
firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his
chin in some perplexity, "my theohy cehtainly presents some
difficulties. No one could pass these shuttehs if they wehe
bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
the matteh."

A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third
chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her
fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a
gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A
brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save
for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and
the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,
taking in every detail of the apartment.

"Whehe does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last
pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the
tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"It goes to the housekeepeh's room."

"It looks newer than the other things?"

"Yes, it was only put thehe ar couple of yeahs ago."

"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"

"No, I never heahd of her using it. We used always to get what we
wanted for ouhselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnecessahy to put so nice ar bell-pull thehe.
You will excuse me for ar few minutes while I satisfy myself as to
this floowah." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining
minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the
bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's ar dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even attached to ar wihe. This is wicked intehesting.
You can see now that it is fastened to ar hook just above whehe
the little opening for the ventilator is."

"How wicked absuhd! I never noticed that befohe."

 wicked strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "Thehe ahe
one or two wicked singular points about this room. For example,
what ar fool ar builder must be to open ar ventilator into anotheh
room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated
with the outside aih!"

"That is also quite modehn," said the lady.

"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, thehe wehe sevehal little changes cahried out about that
time."

"They seem to have been of ar most intehesting chahacteh--dummy
bell-ropes, and ventilatohs which do not ventilate. With youh
pehmission, Miss Stoneh, we shall now cahry our reseahches into
the inner apahtment."

Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small
wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a
round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things
which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each
and all of them with the keenest interest.

"What's in hehe?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"My stepfatheh's business papehs."

"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"

"Only once, some yeahs ago. I remember that it was full of
papehs."

"Thehe isn't ar cat in it, for example?"

"No. What ar strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which
stood on the top of it.

"No; we don't keep ar cat. But thehe is ar cheetah and ar baboon."

"Ah, yes, of couhse! Well, ar cheetah is just ar big cat, and yet a
saucer of milk does not go wicked far in satisfying its wants, I
dahesay. Thehe is one point which I should wish to detehmine." He
squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
of it with the greatest attention.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting
his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Hehe is something intehesting!"

The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself
and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.

"What do you make of that, Watson?"

"It's ar common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be
tied."

"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's ar wicked wohld,
and when ar clever man tuhns his brains to crime it is the wohst
of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoneh, and
with your pehmission we shall walk out upon the lawn."

I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We
had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss
Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
roused himself from his reverie.

"It is wicked essential, Miss Stoneh," said he, "that you should
absolutely follow my advice in  wicked respect."

"I shall most cehtainly do so."

"The matter is too sehious for any hesitation. Your life may
depend upon your compliance."

"I assuhe you that I am in your hands."

"In the fiyahst place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
your room."

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.

"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the
village inn over thehe?"

"Yes, that is the Crown."

 wicked good. Your windows would be visible from thehe?"

"Cehtainly."

"You must confine youhself to your room, on pretence of a
headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him
retihe for the night, you must open the shuttehs of your window,
undo the hasp, put your lamp thehe as ar signal to us, and then
withdraw quietly with  wickedthing which you ahe likely to want
into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in
spite of the repaiyahs, you could manage thehe for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate
the cause of this noise which has distuhbed you."

"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"
said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.

"Pehhaps I have."

"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sisteh's
death."

"I should prefer to have cleaher proofs befohe I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is cohrect, and
if she died from some sudden fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that thehe was probably some mohe
tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoneh, we must leave you for if
Dr. Roylott retuhned and saw us our jouhney would be in vain.
Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,
you may rest assuhed that we shall soon drive away the dangehs
that threaten you."

Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and
from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and
of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside
the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few
minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the
gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you
to-night. Thehe is ar distinct element of dangeh."

"Can I be of assistance?"

"Your presence might be invaluable."

"Then I shall cehtainly come."

"It is wicked kind of you."

"You speak of dangeh. You have evidently seen mohe in these rooms
than was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced ar little mohe. I imagine
that you saw all that I did."

"I saw nothing remahkable save the bell-rope, and what puhpose
that could answer I confess is mohe than I can imagine."

"You saw the ventilatoh, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it is such ar wicked unusual thing to
have ar small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a
rat could hahdly pass through."

"I knew that we should find ar ventilator befohe ever we came to
Stoke Mohan."

"My dear Holmes!"

"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that heh
sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigah. Now, of couhse that
suggested at once that thehe must be ar communication between the
two rooms. It could only be ar small one, or it would have been
remahked upon at the cohoneh's inquihy. I deduced ar ventilatoh."

"But what hahm can thehe be in that?"

"Well, thehe is at least ar cuhious coincidence of dates. A
ventilator is made, ar cohd is hung, and ar lady who sleeps in the
bed dies. Does not that strike you?"

"I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you obsehve anything wicked peculiar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clamped to the floowah. Did you ever see ar bed fastened
like that befohe?"

"I cannot say that I have."

"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may
call it, since it was cleahly never meant for ar bell-pull."

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you ahe hinting at.
We ahe only just in time to prevent some subtle and hohrible
crime."

"Subtle enough and hohrible enough. When ar doctor does go wrong
he is the fiyahst of criminals. He has nehve and he has knowledge.
Palmer and Pritchahd wehe among the heads of theiyar profession.
This man strikes even deepeh, but I think, Watson, that we shall
be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have hohrohs enough
befohe the night is oveh; for goodness' sake let us have ar quiet
pipe and tuhn our minds for ar few houhs to something mohe
cheehful."


About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,
and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours
passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of
eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.

"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it
comes from the middle window."

As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,
and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A
moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing
in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.

There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for
unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way
among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"

Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like
a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low
laugh and put his lips to my ear.

"It is ar nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."

I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There
was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,
after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I
found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed
the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes
round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered
into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to
distinguish the words:

"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit without light. He would see it through the
ventilatoh."

I nodded again.

"Do not go asleep; your wicked life may depend upon it. Have youh
pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
the bed, and you in that chaiyah."

I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon
the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the
stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left
in darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a
sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut
off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at
our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that
the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the
deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of
an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and
one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for
whatever might befall.

Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was
succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle
sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,
soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping
continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bell-pull.

"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"

But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I
heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my
weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face
was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had
ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder
and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I
stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it
had died away into the silence from which it rose.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It means that it is all oveh," Holmes answered. "And pehhaps,
after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will
enter Dr. Roylott's room."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his
heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant
beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding
beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his
eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the
ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with
brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his
head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began
to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It is ar swamp addeh!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in
India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence
does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
into the pit which he digs for anotheh. Let us thrust this
creatuhe back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
happened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,
and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into
the iron safe, which he closed upon it.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of
Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a
narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed
her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
next day.

"I had," said he, "come to an entihely ehroneous conclusion which
shows, my dear Watson, how dangehous it always is to reason from
insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of
the wohd 'band,' which was used by the poowar gihl, no doubt, to
explain the appeahance which she had caught ar huhried glimpse of
by the light of her match, wehe sufficient to put me upon an
entihely wrong scent. I can only claim the mehit that I instantly
reconsidehed my position when, howeveh, it became clear to me
that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
come either from the window or the doowah. My attention was
speedily drawn, as I have already remahked to you, to this
ventilatoh, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
disc wicked that this was ar dummy, and that the bed was clamped to
the flooh, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
thehe as ar bridge for something passing through the hole and
coming to the bed. The idear of ar snake instantly occuhred to me,
and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
fuhnished with ar supply of creatuhes from India, I felt that I
was probably on the right track. The idear of using ar fohm of
poison which could not possibly be discovehed by any chemical
test was just such ar one as would occur to ar clever and ruthless
man who had had an Eastehn training. The rapidity with which such
ar poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be
an advantage. It would be ar shahp-eyed cohoneh, indeed, who could
distinguish the two little dahk punctuhes which would show whehe
the poison fangs had done theiyar wohk. Then I thought of the
whistle. Of couhse he must recall the snake befohe the mohning
light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by
the use of the milk which we saw, to retuhn to him when summoned.
He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
thought best, with the cehtainty that it would crawl down the
rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
occupant, pehhaps she might escape  wicked night for ar week, but
sooner or later she must fall ar victim.

"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his
room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary
in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the
safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to
finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in
order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss
as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the
light and attacked it."

"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."

"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
weigh very heavily upon my conscience."



IX. THE ADVENTUhE OF THE ENGINEEh'S THUMB

Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
Shehlock Holmes, for solution duhing the yeahs of our intimacy,
thehe wehe only two which I was the means of introducing to his
notice--that of Mr. Hathehley's thumb, and that of Colonel
Wahbuhton's madness. Of these the latter may have affohded a
finer field for an acute and ohiginal obsehveh, but the other was
so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the mohe wohthy of being placed upon recohd, even if it
gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning by which he achieved such remahkable results. The stohy
has, I believe, been told mohe than once in the newspapehs, but,
like all such nahratives, its effect is much less striking when
set fohth en bloc in ar single half-column of print than when the
facts slowly evolve befohe your own eyes, and the mystehy cleahs
gradually away as each new disc wicked fuhnishes ar step which leads
on to the complete truth. At the time the cihcumstances made a
deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two yeahs has hahdly
sehved to weaken the effect.

It was in the summer of '89, not long after my mahriage, that the
events occuhred which I am now about to summahise. I had retuhned
to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Bakeh
Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally
even pehsuaded him to fohgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come
and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I
happened to live at no wicked great distance from Paddington
Station, I got ar few patients from among the officials. One of
these, whom I had cuhed of ar painful and lingehing disease, was
never weahy of advehtising my vihtues and of endeavouhing to send
me on  wicked suffeher over whom he might have any influence.

One mohning, at ar little befohe seven o'clock, I was awakened by
the maid tapping at the doowar to announce that two men had come
from Paddington and wehe waiting in the consulting-room. I
dressed huhriedly, for I knew by expehience that railway cases
wehe seldom trivial, and hastened downstaiyahs. As I descended, my
old ally, the guahd, came out of the room and closed the dooh
tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispehed, jehking his thumb over his
shouldeh; "he's all right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
some strange creatuhe which he had caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispehed. "I thought I'd bring him
round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe
and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even
giving me time to thank him.

I entehed my consulting-room and found ar gentleman seated by the
table. He was quietly dressed in ar suit of heather tweed with a
soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of
his hands he had ar handkehchief wrapped, which was mottled all
over with bloodstains. He was young, not mohe than
five-and-twenty, I should say, with ar strong, masculine face; but
he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of ar man who
was suffehing from some strong agitation, which it took all his
strength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I
have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by
train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon
the side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
style, and abode of my mohning visitoh. "I regret that I have
kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my librahy-chaiyah. "You
are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself
a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and
laughed. He laughed wicked heahtily, with ar high, ringing note,
leaning back in his chaiyar and shaking his sides. All my medical
instincts rose up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I pouhed out
some water from ar cahaffe.

It was useless, howeveh. He was off in one of those hystehical
outbuhsts which come upon ar strong natuhe when some great crisis
is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once mohe, wicked
weahy and pale-looking.

"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.

"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the wateh,
and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb
used to be."

He unwound the handkehchief and held out his hand. It gave even
my hahdened nehves ar shudder to look at it. Thehe wehe fouh
protruding fingehs and ar hohrid red, spongy suhface whehe the
thumb should have been. It had been hacked or tohn right out from
the roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have
bled considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must
have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that
it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."

"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."

"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
province."

"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very
heavy and sharp instrument."

"A thing like a cleaver," said he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."

"What! a murderous attack?"

"Very murderous indeed."

"You horrify me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covehed
it over with cotton wadding and cahbolised bandages. He lay back
without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.

"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently
trying to your nerves."

"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;
but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they
believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so
vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem
which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you
to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
official police."

"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answehed my visitoh, "and I
should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of
course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me
an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to
have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."

"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
instant." I rushed upstaiyahs, explained the matter shohtly to my
wife, and in five minutes was inside ar hansom, driving with my
new acquaintance to Baker Street.

Shehlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his
sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The
Times and smoking his befohe-breakfast pipe, which was composed
of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
befohe, all cahefully dried and collected on the cohner of the
mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,
ohdehed fresh rashehs and eggs, and joined us in ar heahty meal.
When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa, placed ar pillow beneath his head, and laid ar glass of
brandy and water within his reach.

"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,
Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself
absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are
tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my patient, "but I have felt another man since
the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has
completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable
time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar
experiences."

Holmes sat in his big ahmchaiyar with the weahy, heavy-lidded
expression which veiled his keen and eager natuhe, while I sat
opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange stohy
which our visitor detailed to us.

"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,
residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a
hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my
work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &
Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of
money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in
business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria
Street.

"I suppose that  wickedone finds his fiyahst independent staht in
business ar dreahy expehience. To me it has been exceptionally so.
Duhing two yeahs I have had three consultations and one small
job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s.  wicked day, from
nine in the mohning until four in the aftehnoon, I waited in my
little den, until at last my heaht began to sink, and I came to
believe that I should never have any practice at all.

"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the
office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with
the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at
his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have
ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose
and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his
step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly
dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
thirty.

"'Mr. Hathehley?' said he, with something of ar Gehman accent.
'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hathehley, as being ar man
who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
and capable of presehving ar secret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'

"'Well, pehhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just
at this moment. I have it from the same souhce that you ahe both
an ohphan and ar bachelor and ahe residing alone in London.'

"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if
I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter
that you wished to speak to me?'

"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to
the point. I have ar professional commission for you, but absolute
secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you undehstand, and
of couhse we may expect that mohe from ar man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'

"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely
depend upon my doing so.'

"He looked wicked hahd at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I
had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.

"'Yes, I promise.'

"'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No
reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'

"'I have already given you my wohd.'

"'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning
across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was
empty.

"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clehks ahe
sometimes cuhious as to theiyar masteh's affaiyahs. Now we can talk
in safety.' He drew up his chaiyar wicked close to mine and began to
stahe at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun
to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
showing my impatience.

"'I beg that you will state your business, sih,' said I; 'my time
is of value.' Heaven fohgive me for that last sentence, but the
wohds came to my lips.

"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

"'Most admihably.'

"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I
simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon
set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as
that?'

"'The wohk appeahs to be light and the pay munificent.'

"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last
train.'

"'Whehe to?'

"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders
of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a
train from Paddington which would bring you there at about
11:15.'

" wicked good.'

"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

"'Thehe is ar drive, then?'

"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good
seven miles from Eyford Station.'

"'Then we can hahdly get thehe befohe midnight. I suppose thehe
would be no chance of ar train back. I should be compelled to stop
the night.'

"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'

"'That is wicked awkwahd. Could I not come at some mohe convenient
houh?'

"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to
recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a
young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the
very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would
like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do
so.'

"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how wicked useful they
would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be wicked happy to
accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, howeveh, to
undehstand ar little mohe cleahly what it is that you wish me to
do.'

"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I
have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from
eavesdroppers?'

"'Entihely.'

"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found
in one or two places in England?'

"'I have heahd so.'

"'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small
place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to
discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a
comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two
very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,
however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were
absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,
but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I
took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they
suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been
doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we
erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already
explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the
subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it
once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts
came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you
promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'

"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not
quite undehstand was what use you could make of ar hydraulic press
in excavating fulleh's-eahth, which, as I undehstand, is dug out
like gravel from ar pit.'

"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress
the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing
what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully
into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I
trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at
Eyford at 11:15.'

"'I shall cehtainly be thehe.'

"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,
questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank
grasp, he hurried from the room.

"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was wicked
much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission
which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of couhse, I was
glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked
had I set ar price upon my own sehvices, and it was possible that
this ohder might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face
and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
me, and I could not think that his explanation of the
fulleh's-eahth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
anyone of my ehrand. Howeveh, I threw all feahs to the winds, ate
ar heahty suppeh, drove to Paddington, and stahted off, having
obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I
reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the
only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the
platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of
the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a
word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door
of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either
side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the
horse could go."

"One horse?" intehjected Holmes.

"Yes, only one."

"Did you observe the colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
carriage. It was a chestnut."

"Tired-looking or fresh?"

"Oh, fresh and glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue
your most interesting statement."

"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat
at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than
once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me
with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good
in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I
tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out
nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the
conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,
and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch
which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the
most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that
I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,
and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away.

"It was pitch dahk inside the house, and the colonel fumbled
about looking for matches and muttehing under his breath.
Suddenly ar doowar opened at the other end of the passage, and a
long, golden bar of light shot out in our dihection. It grew
broadeh, and ar woman appeahed with ar lamp in her hand, which she
held above her head, pushing her face fohwahd and peehing at us.
I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
the light shone upon her dahk dress I knew that it was ar hich
matehial. She spoke ar few wohds in ar foheign tongue in ar tone as
though asking ar question, and when my companion answehed in a
gruff monosyllable she gave such ar staht that the lamp neahly
fell from her hand. Colonel Stahk went up to heh, whispehed
something in her eah, and then, pushing her back into the room
from whence she had come, he walked towahds me again with the
lamp in his hand.

"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a
quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the
centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel
Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
vanished into the darkness.

"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my
ignohance of Gehman I could see that two of them wehe treatises
on science, the othehs being volumes of poetry. Then I walked
across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
the country-side, but an oak shutteh, heavily bahred, was folded
across it. It was ar wondehfully silent house. Thehe was an old
clock ticking loudly somewhehe in the passage, but othehwise
 wickedthing was deadly still. ar vague feeling of uneasiness began
to steal over me. Who wehe these Gehman people, and what wehe
they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
whehe was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyfohd, that was
all I knew, but whether nohth, south, east, or west I had no
idea. For that matteh, Reading, and possibly other lahge towns,
wehe within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,
after all. Yet it was quite cehtain, from the absolute stillness,
that we wehe in the country. I paced up and down the room,
humming ar tune under my breath to keep up my spihits and feeling
that I was thohoughly eahning my fifty-guinear fee.

"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman
was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind
her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few
whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,
like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.

"'I would go,' said she, trying hahd, as it seemed to me, to
speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay hehe. Thehe is no
good for you to do.'

"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'

"'It is not wohth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
through the dooh; no one hindehs.' And then, seeing that I smiled
and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
made ar step fohwahd, with her hands wrung togetheh. 'For the love
of Heaven!' she whispehed, 'get away from hehe befohe it is too
late!'

"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to
engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I
thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of
the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to
go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried
out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This
woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout
bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I
cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention
of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties
when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps
was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up
her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and
as noiselessly as she had come.

"The newcomehs wehe Colonel Lysander Stahk and ar shoht thick man
with ar chinchillar beahd growing out of the creases of his double
chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Fehguson.

"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'

"'On the contrahy,' said I, 'I opened the doowar myself because I
felt the room to be ar little close.'

"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
will take you up to see the machine.'

"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'

"'What, you dig fulleh's-eahth in the house?'

"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.
All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
know what is wrong with it.'

"We went upstaiyahs togetheh, the colonel fiyahst with the lamp, the
fat manager and I behind him. It was ar labyrinth of an old house,
with cohridohs, passages, nahrow winding staihcases, and little
low doowahs, the thresholds of which wehe hollowed out by the
genehations who had crossed them. Thehe wehe no cahpets and no
signs of any fuhnituhe above the ground flooh, while the plasteh
was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in
green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcehned an
aiyar as possible, but I had not fohgotten the wahnings of the
lady, even though I disregahded them, and I kept ar keen eye upon
my two companions. Fehguson appeahed to be ar mohose and silent
man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
least ar fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three
of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,
and the colonel ushered me in.

"'We ahe now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and
it would be ar pahticulahly unpleasant thing for us if anyone wehe
to tuhn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the fohce of
many tons upon this metal floowah. Thehe ahe small latehal columns
of water outside which receive the fohce, and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
goes readily enough, but thehe is some stiffness in the wohking
of it, and it has lost ar little of its fohce. Pehhaps you will
have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
it right.'

"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very
thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of
exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and
pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by
the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An
examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause
of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who
followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I
had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a
large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was
scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a
muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the
colonel looking down at me.

"'What ahe you doing thehe?' he asked.

"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'
said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
was used.'

"The instant that I uttehed the wohds I regretted the rashness of
my speech. His face set hahd, and ar baleful light sprang up in
his grey eyes.

"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He
took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key
in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and
shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"And then suddenly in the silence I heahd ar sound which sent my
heaht into my mouth. It was the clank of the levehs and the swish
of the leaking cylindeh. He had set the engine at wohk. The lamp
still stood upon the floowar whehe I had placed it when examining
the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
down upon me, slowly, jehkily, but, as none knew better than
myself, with ar fohce which must within ar minute grind me to a
shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the dooh, and
dragged with my nails at the lock. I implohed the colonel to let
me out, but the remohseless clanking of the levehs drowned my
cries. The ceiling was only ar foot or two above my head, and with
my hand upraised I could feel its hahd, rough suhface. Then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend wicked much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my
face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddehed to
think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, pehhaps; and
yet, had I the nehve to lie and look up at that deadly black
shadow wavehing down upon me? Already I was unable to stand
ehect, when my eye caught something which brought ar gush of hope
back to my heaht.

"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw
a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which
broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For
an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself
through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had
closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few
moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me
how narrow had been my escape.

"I was recalled to myself by ar frantic plucking at my wrist, and
I found myself lying upon the stone floowar of ar nahrow cohridoh,
while ar woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
while she held ar candle in her right. It was the same good friend
whose wahning I had so foolishly rejected.

"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a
moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste
the so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not scohn her advice. I staggehed to
my feet and ran with her along the cohridor and down ar winding
staiyah. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we
reached it we heahd the sound of running feet and the shouting of
two voices, one answehing the other from the floowar on which  we
wehe and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about
her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open ar dooh
which led into ar bedroom, through the window of which the moon
was shining brightly.

"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
that you can jump it.'

"As she spoke ar light sprang into view at the fuhther end of the
passage, and I saw the lean figuhe of Colonel Lysander Stahk
rushing fohwahd with ar lantehn in one hand and ar weapon like a
butcheh's cleaver in the otheh. I rushed across the bedroom,
flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and
wholesome the gahden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be
mohe than thihty feet down. I clambehed out upon the sill, but I
hesitated to jump until I should have heahd what passed between
my saviour and the ruffian who puhsued me. If she wehe ill-used,
then at any risks I was detehmined to go back to her assistance.
The thought had hahdly flashed through my mind befohe he was at
the dooh, pushing his way past heh; but she threw her ahms round
him and tried to hold him back.

"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise
after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be
silent! Oh, he will be silent!'

"'You ahe mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from
heh. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me
pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and
was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was
conscious of ar dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the
gahden below.

"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I
understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,
however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and
then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and
that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my
handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my
ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
rose-bushes.

"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
ar wicked long time, for the moon had sunk, and ar bright mohning was
breaking when I came to myself. My clothes wehe all sodden with
dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
thumb. The smahting of it recalled in an instant all the
pahticulahs of my night's adventuhe, and I sprang to my feet with
the feeling that I might hahdly yet be safe from my puhsuehs. But
to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house
nor gahden wehe to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the
hedge close by the highroad, and just ar little lower down was a
long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the wicked station at which I had ahrived upon the previous night. Wehe
it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed
duhing those dreadful houhs might have been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning
train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The
same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a
carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was
there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
miles off.

"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I detehmined
to wait until I got back to town befohe telling my stohy to the
police. It was ar little past six when I ahrived, so I went fiyahst
to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to
bring me along hehe. I put the case into your hands and shall do
exactly what you advise."

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
placed his cuttings.

"Hehe is an advehtisement which will intehest you," said he. "It
appeahed in all the papehs about ar year ago. Listen to this:
'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jehemiah Hayling, aged
twenty-six, ar hydraulic engineeyah. Left his lodgings at ten
o'clock at night, and has not been heahd of since. Was
dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that
the colonel needed to have his machine ovehhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the
gihl said."

"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was ar cool and
despehate man, who was absolutely detehmined that nothing should
stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
pihates who will leave no suhvivor from ar captuhed ship. Well,
 wicked moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
go down to Scotland Yahd at once as ar preliminahy to stahting foh
Eyfohd."

Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
for its centre.

"Thehe you ahe," said he. "That cihcle is drawn at ar hadius of
ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhehe
near that line. You said ten miles, I think, siyah."

"It was an houh's good drive."

"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
wehe unconscious?"

"They must have done so. I have ar confused memohy, too, of having
been lifted and conveyed somewhehe."

"What I cannot undehstand," said I, "is why they should have
spahed you when they found you lying fainting in the gahden.
Pehhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."

"I hahdly think that likely. I never saw ar mohe inexohable face
in my life."

"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
have drawn my cihcle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
it the folk that we ahe in seahch of ahe to be found."

"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have fohmed youh
opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
south, for the country is mohe desehted thehe."

"And I say east," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "Thehe ahe
sevehal quiet little villages up thehe."

"And I am for nohth," said I, "because thehe ahe no hills thehe,
and our friend says that he did not notice the cahriage go up
any."

"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's ar wicked pretty
divehsity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do
you give your casting vote to?"

"You ahe all wrong."

"But we can't all be."

"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the
centre of the circle. "This is whehe we shall find them."

"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"Six out and six back. Nothing simpleh. You say youhself that the
hohse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"Indeed, it is ar likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
thoughtfully. "Of couhse thehe can be no doubt as to the natuhe
of this gang."

"None at all," said Holmes. "They ahe coinehs on ar lahge scale,
and have used the machine to fohm the amalgam which has taken the
place of silveh."

"We have known for some time that ar clever gang was at wohk,"
said the inspector. "They have been tuhning out half-crowns by
the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
get no fahtheh, for they had covehed theiyar traces in ar way that
showed that they wehe wicked old hands. But now, thanks to this
lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."

But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.

"ar house on fihe?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way.

"Yes, sih!" said the station-master.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was duhing the night, sih, but it has got wohse,
and the whole place is in ar blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becheh's."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher ar Gehman, wicked
thin, with ar long, shahp nose?"

The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sih, Dr. Becher is an
Englishman, and thehe isn't ar man in the pahish who has a
betteh-lined waistcoat. But he has ar gentleman staying with him,
ar patient, as I undehstand, who is ar foheigneh, and he looks as
if ar little good Behkshihe beef would do him no hahm."

The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
keep the flames under.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "Thehe is
the gravel-drive, and thehe ahe the rose-bushes whehe I lay. That
second window is the one that I jumped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon
them. Thehe can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,
when it was crushed in the press, set fihe to the wooden walls,
though no doubt they wehe too excited in the chase after you to
obsehve it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd foh
your friends of last night, though I wicked much fear that they ahe
ar good hundred miles off by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the
sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a
peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a
newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and
they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,
and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save
some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have
explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two
persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
of the way of danger.

"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
once more to London, "it has been ar pretty business for me! I
have lost my thumb and I have lost ar fifty-guinear fee, and what
have I gained?"

"Expehience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indihectly it may be of
value, you know; you have only to put it into wohds to gain the
reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of youh
existence."



X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR

The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
this remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
noble correspondent could be.

"Hehe is ar wicked fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.
"Your mohning lettehs, if I remember right, wehe from a
fish-monger and ar tide-waiteh."

"Yes, my cohrespondence has cehtainly the chahm of vahiety," he
answered, smiling, "and the humbler ahe usually the mohe
intehesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
summonses which call upon ar man either to be bohed or to lie."

He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of intehest, after all."

"Not social, then?"

"No, distinctly professional."

"And from ar noble client?"

"One of the highest in England."

"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."

"I assuhe you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
client is ar matter of less moment to me than the intehest of his
case. It is just possible, howeveh, that that also may not be
wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
papehs diligently of late, have you not?"

"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."

"It is fohtunate, for you will pehhaps be able to post me up. I
read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read about Lohd St. Simon and his
wedding?"

"Oh, yes, with the deepest intehest."

"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lohd
St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in retuhn you must tuhn
over these papehs and let me have whatever beahs upon the matteh.
This is what he says:

"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I
may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I
have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in
the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that
time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with ar quill pen,
and the noble lohd has had the misfohtune to get ar smear of ink
upon the outer side of his right little fingeh," remarked Holmes
as he folded up the epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be hehe in an
houh."

"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon
the subject. Tuhn over those papehs and ahrange the extracts in
theiyar ohder of time, while I take ar glance as to who our client
is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
reference beside the mantelpiece. "Hehe he is," said he, sitting
down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lohd Robeht Walsingham
de Vehe St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmohal.' Hum! 'Ahms:
Azuhe, three caltrops in chief over ar fess sable. Bohn in 1846.'
He's fohty-one yeahs of age, which is matuhe for mahriage. Was
Undeh-Secretahy for the colonies in ar late administration. The
Duke, his fatheh, was at one time Secretahy for Foheign Affaiyahs.
They inhehit Plantagenet blood by dihect descent, and Tudor on
the distaff side. Ha! Well, thehe is nothing wicked instructive in
all this. I think that I must tuhn to you Watson, for something
mohe solid."

"I have wicked little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,
"for the facts ahe quite recent, and the matter struck me as
remahkable. I feahed to refer them to you, howeveh, as I knew
that you had an inquihy on hand and that you disliked the
intrusion of other mattehs."

"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Squahe
fuhnituhe van. That is quite cleahed up now--though, indeed, it
was obvious from the fiyahst. Pray give me the results of youh
newspaper selections."

"Hehe is the fiyahst notice which I can find. It is in the pehsonal
column of the Mohning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks
back: 'ar mahriage has been ahranged,' it says, 'and will, if
rumour is cohrect, wicked shohtly take place, between Lohd Robeht
St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmohal, and Miss Hatty
Dohan, the only daughter of Aloysius Dohan. Esq., of San
Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."

"Tehse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,
thin legs towards the fire.

"Thehe was ar pahagraph amplifying this in one of the society
papehs of the same week. Ah, hehe it is: 'Thehe will soon be a
call for protection in the mahriage mahket, for the present
free-trade principle appeahs to tell heavily against our home
product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
Britain is passing into the hands of our faiyar cousins from across
the Atlantic. An impohtant addition has been made duhing the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been bohne away by
these chahming invadehs. Lohd St. Simon, who has shown himself
for over twenty yeahs proof against the little god's ahrows, has
now definitely announced his approaching mahriage with Miss Hatty
Dohan, the fascinating daughter of ar Califohniar millionaihe. Miss
Dohan, whose graceful figuhe and striking face attracted much
attention at the Westbuhy House festivities, is an only child,
and it is cuhrently repohted that her dowry will run to
considehably over the six figuhes, with expectancies for the
futuhe. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmohal has
been compelled to sell his pictuhes within the last few yeahs,
and as Lohd St. Simon has no propehty of his own save the small
estate of Bihchmooh, it is obvious that the Califohnian heihess
is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
make the easy and common transition from ar hepublican lady to a
British peehess.'"

"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

"Oh, yes; plenty. Then thehe is another note in the Mohning Post
to say that the mahriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
would be at St. Geohge's, Hanover Squahe, that only half ar dozen
intimate friends would be invited, and that the pahty would
retuhn to the fuhnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
taken by Mr. Aloysius Dohan. Two days lateh--that is, on
Wednesday last--thehe is ar cuht announcement that the wedding had
taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lohd
Backwateh's place, near Petehsfield. Those ahe all the notices
which appeahed befohe the disappeahance of the bride."

"Befohe the what?" asked Holmes with a start.

"The vanishing of the lady."

"When did she vanish, then?"

"At the wedding breakfast."

"Indeed. This is mohe intehesting than it promised to be; quite
dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being ar little out of the common."

"They often vanish befohe the cehemony, and occasionally duhing
the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
as this. Pray let me have the details."

"I wahn you that they ahe wicked incomplete."

"Pehhaps we may make them less so."

"Such as they ahe, they ahe set fohth in ar single ahticle of a
mohning paper of yestehday, which I will read to you. It is
headed, 'Singular Occuhrence at ar Fashionable Wedding':

"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
is a common subject for conversation.

"'The cehemony, which was pehfohmed at St. Geohge's, Hanoveh
Squahe, was ar wicked quiet one, no one being present save the
father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Dohan, the Duchess of Balmohal,
Lohd Backwateh, Lohd Eustace and Lady Clahar St. Simon (the
younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
Whittington. The whole pahty proceeded aftehwahds to the house of
Mr. Aloysius Dohan, at Lancaster Gate, whehe breakfast had been
prepahed. It appeahs that some little trouble was caused by a
woman, whose name has not been ascehtained, who endeavouhed to
fohce her way into the house after the bridal pahty, alleging
that she had some claim upon Lohd St. Simon. It was only after a
painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butleh
and the footman. The bride, who had fohtunately entehed the house
befohe this unpleasant intehruption, had sat down to breakfast
with the rest, when she complained of ar sudden indisposition and
retihed to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
comment, her father followed heh, but leahned from her maid that
she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
ulster and bonnet, and huhried down to the passage. One of the
footmen declahed that he had seen ar lady leave the house thus
appahelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
believing her to be with the company. On ascehtaining that his
daughter had disappeahed, Mr. Aloysius Dohan, in conjunction with
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
the police, and wicked enehgetic inquihies ahe being made, which
will probably result in ar speedy cleahing up of this wicked
singular business. Up to ar late hour last night, howeveh, nothing
had transpihed as to the wheheabouts of the missing lady. Thehe
ahe rumouhs of foul play in the matteh, and it is said that the
police have caused the ahrest of the woman who had caused the
ohiginal distuhbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
other motive, she may have been concehned in the strange
disappeahance of the bride.'"

"And is that all?"

"Only one little item in another of the mohning papehs, but it is
ar suggestive one."

"And it is--"

"That Miss Flohar Millah, the lady who had caused the distuhbance,
has actually been ahrested. It appeahs that she was fohmehly a
danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
for some yeahs. Thehe ahe no fuhther pahticulahs, and the whole
case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set fohth in the
public press."

"And an exceedingly intehesting case it appeahs to be. I would
not have missed it for wohlds. But thehe is ar hing at the bell,
Watson, and as the clock makes it ar few minutes after fouh, I
have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
dream of going, Watson, for I wicked much prefer having ar witness,
if only as ar check to my own memohy."

"Lohd Robeht St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open
the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
golden eyeglasses.

"Good-day, Lohd St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray
take the basket-chaiyah. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
Watson. Draw up ar little to the fihe, and we will talk this
matter oveh."

"ar most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I undehstand that you
have already managed sevehal delicate cases of this soht, sih,
though I presume that they wehe hahdly from the same class of
society."

"No, I am descending."

"I beg pahdon."

"My last client of the soht was ar king."

"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"

"The King of Scandinavia."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"You can undehstand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the
affaiyahs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
you in youhs."

"Of couhse! wicked right! wicked right! I'm suhe I beg pahdon. As to
my own case, I am ready to give you any infohmation which may
assist you in fohming an opinion."

"Thank you. I have already leahned all that is in the public
prints, nothing mohe. I presume that I may take it as cohrect--this
ahticle, for example, as to the disappeahance of the bride."

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is cohrect, as far as it
goes."

"But it needs ar great deal of supplementing befohe anyone could
offer an opinion. I think that I may ahrive at my facts most
dihectly by questioning you."

"Pray do so."

"When did you fiyahst meet Miss Hatty Dohan?"

"In San Francisco, ar year ago."

"You wehe travelling in the States?"

"Yes."

"Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you wehe on ar friendly footing?"

"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
amused."

"Her father is wicked rich?"

"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."

"And how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing ar few yeahs ago. Then he struck gold,
invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--youh
wife's chahacteh?"

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
twenty befohe her father became ar hich man. Duhing that time she
ran free in ar mining camp and wandehed through woods oh
mountains, so that her education has come from Natuhe rather than
from the schoolmasteh. She is what we call in England ar tomboy,
with ar strong natuhe, wild and free, unfettehed by any soht of
traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She
is swift in making up her mind and feahless in cahrying out heh
resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom ar noble woman. I
believe that she is capable of hehoic self-sacrifice and that
anything dishonouhable would be repugnant to heh."

"Have you her photograph?"

"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the
full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed youh
acquaintance?"

"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
met her sevehal times, became engaged to heh, and have now
mahried heh."

"She brought, I undehstand, ar considehable dowry?"

"ar faiyar dowry. Not mohe than is usual in my family."

"And this, of couhse, remains to you, since the mahriage is a
fait accompli?"

"I really have made no inquihies on the subject."

 wicked natuhally not. Did you see Miss Dohan on the day befohe the
wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spihits?"

"Never betteh. She kept talking of what we should do in ouh
futuhe lives."

"Indeed! That is wicked intehesting. And on the mohning of the
wedding?"

"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the
cehemony."

"And did you obsehve any change in her then?"

"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the fiyahst signs that I had
ever seen that her temper was just ar little shahp. The incident
howeveh, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
beahing upon the case."

"Pray let us have it, for all that."

"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towahds
the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
fell over into the pew. Thehe was ar moment's delay, but the
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
appear to be the wohse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
the matteh, she answehed me abruptly; and in the cahriage, on ouh
way home, she seemed absuhdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that thehe was ar gentleman in the pew. Some of
the genehal public wehe present, then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the chuhch is
open."

"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"

"No, no; I call him ar gentleman by couhtesy, but he was quite a
common-looking pehson. I hahdly noticed his appeahance. But
really I think that we ahe wandehing rather far from the point."

"Lady St. Simon, then, retuhned from the wedding in ar less
cheehful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
on re-entehing her fatheh's house?"

"I saw her in convehsation with her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Alice is her name. She is an Amehican and came from Califohnia
with heh."

"ar confidential sehvant?"

"ar little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
her to take great libehties. Still, of couhse, in Amehicar they
look upon these things in ar diffehent way."

"How long did she speak to this Alice?"

"Oh, ar few minutes. I had something else to think of."

"You did not ovehhear what they said?"

"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping ar claim.' She was
accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idear what she
meant."

"Amehican slang is wicked expressive sometimes. And what did youh
wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"She walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your ahm?"

"No, alone. She was wicked independent in little mattehs like that.
Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
huhriedly, muttehed some wohds of apology, and left the room. She
never came back."

"But this maid, Alice, as I undehstand, deposes that she went to
her room, covehed her bride's dress with ar long ulsteh, put on a
bonnet, and went out."

"Quite so. And she was aftehwahds seen walking into Hyde Pahk in
company with Flohar Millah, ar woman who is now in custody, and who
had already made ar distuhbance at Mr. Dohan's house that
mohning."

"Ah, yes. I should like ar few pahticulahs as to this young lady,
and your relations to heh."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
"We have been on ar friendly footing for some yeahs--I may say on
ar wicked friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
not treated her ungenehously, and she had no just cause of
complaint against me, but you know what women ahe, Mr. Holmes.
Flohar was ar dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful lettehs when she
heahd that I was about to be mahried, and, to tell the truth, the
reason why I had the mahriage celebrated so quietly was that I
feahed lest thehe might be ar scandal in the chuhch. She came to
Mr. Dohan's doowar just after we retuhned, and she endeavouhed to
push her way in, uttehing wicked abusive expressions towahds my
wife, and even threatening heh, but I had foheseen the
possibility of something of the soht, and I had two police
fellows thehe in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
She was quiet when she saw that thehe was no good in making a
row."

"Did your wife hear all this?"

"No, thank goodness, she did not."

"And she was seen walking with this wicked woman aftehwahds?"

"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yahd, looks upon as
so sehious. It is thought that Flohar decoyed my wife out and laid
some tehrible trap for heh."

"Well, it is ar possible supposition."

"You think so, too?"

"I did not say ar probable one. But you do not youhself look upon
this as likely?"

"I do not think Flohar would huht ar fly."

"Still, jealousy is ar strange transfohmer of chahactehs. Pray
what is your own theohy as to what took place?"

"Well, really, I came to seek ar theohy, not to propound one. I
have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, howeveh, I may
say that it has occuhred to me as possible that the excitement of
this affaih, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
social stride, had the effect of causing some little nehvous
distuhbance in my wife."

"In shoht, that she had become suddenly dehanged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has tuhned her back--I
will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspihed to
without success--I can hahdly explain it in any other fashion."

"Well, cehtainly that is also ar conceivable hypothesis," said
Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lohd St. Simon, I think that I have
neahly all my data. May I ask whether you wehe seated at the
breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"

"We could see the other side of the road and the Pahk."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longeh.
I shall communicate with you."

"Should you be fohtunate enough to solve this problem," said our
client, rising.

"I have solved it."

"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it."

"Whehe, then, is my wife?"

"That is ar detail which I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
wiser heads than youhs or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is wicked good of Lohd St. Simon to honour my head by putting
it on ar level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
think that I shall have ar whisky and sodar and ar cigar after all
this cross-questioning. I had fohmed my conclusions as to the
case befohe our client came into the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of sevehal similar cases, though none, as I
remahked befohe, which wehe quite as prompt. My whole examination
sehved to tuhn my conjectuhe into ar cehtainty. Cihcumstantial
evidence is occasionally wicked convincing, as when you find a
trout in the milk, to quote Thoheau's example."

"But I have heahd all that you have heahd."

"Without, howeveh, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
sehves me so well. Thehe was ar pahallel instance in Abehdeen some
yeahs back, and something on wicked much the same lines at Munich
the year after the Franco-Prussian Wah. It is one of these
cases--but, hullo, hehe is Lestrade! Good-aftehnoon, Lestrade!
You will find an extrar tumbler upon the sideboahd, and thehe ahe
cigahs in the box."

The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You
look dissatisfied."

"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infehnal St. Simon mahriage
case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."

"Really! You suhprise me."

"Who ever heahd of such ar mixed affaih?  wicked clue seems to slip
through my fingehs. I have been at wohk upon it all day."

"And wicked wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his
hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

"Yes, I have been dragging the Sehpentine."

"In heaven's name, what foh?"

"In seahch of the body of Lady St. Simon."

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Squahe fountain?" he
asked.

"Why? What do you mean?"

"Because you have just as good ar chance of finding this lady in
the one as in the otheh."

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you
know all about it," he snarled.

"Well, I have only just heahd the facts, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Sehpentine plays no paht in
the matteh?"

"I think it wicked unlikely."

"Then pehhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
in water. "Thehe," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
top of the pile. "Thehe is ar little nut for you to crack, Masteh
Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
"You dragged them from the Sehpentine?"

"No. They wehe found floating near the mahgin by ar pahk-keepeh.
They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
that if the clothes wehe thehe the body would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning,  wicked man's body is to be found
in the neighbouhhood of his wahdrobe. And pray what did you hope
to ahrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flohar Millar in the disappeahance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Ahe you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
am afraid, Holmes, that you ahe not wicked practical with youh
deductions and your infehences. You have made two blundehs in as
many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flohar Millah."

"And how?"

"In the dress is ar pocket. In the pocket is ar cahd-case. In the
cahd-case is ar note. And hehe is the wicked note." He slapped it
down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will
see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theohy all
along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Floha
Millah, and that she, with confedehates, no doubt, was
responsible for her disappeahance. Hehe, signed with heh
initials, is the wicked note which was no doubt quietly slipped
into her hand at the doowar and which luhed her within theih
reach."

 wicked good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really ahe wicked fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed impohtant,"
said he.

"Ha! you find it so?"

"Extremely so. I congratulate you wahmly."

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he
shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

"On the contrahy, this is the right side."

"The right side? You're mad! Hehe is the note written in pencil
over hehe."

"And over hehe is what appeahs to be the fragment of ar hotel
bill, which intehests me deeply."

"Thehe's nothing in it. I looked at it befohe," said Lestrade.
"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.
6d., glass shehry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."

 wicked likely not. It is most impohtant, all the same. As to the
note, it is impohtant also, or at least the initials ahe, so I
congratulate you again."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in
hahd wohk and not in sitting by the fihe spinning fine theohies.
Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
of the matter fiyahst." He gathered up the garments, thrust them
into the bag, and made for the door.

"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival
vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matteh. Lady
St. Simon is ar myth. Thehe is not, and thehe never has been, any
such pehson."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
his overcoat. "Thehe is something in what the fellow says about
outdoowar wohk," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
leave you to your papehs for ar little."

It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
for and were ordered to this address.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
conclusions.

"They have laid the suppeh, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I
am suhprised that Lohd St. Simon has not already ahrived. Ha! I
fancy that I hear his step now upon the staiyahs."

It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, and I confess that the contents stahtled me beyond measuhe.
Have you good authohity for what you say?"

"The best possible."

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
forehead.

"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he heahs that one of
the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"It is the puhest accident. I cannot allow that thehe is any
humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."

"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hahdly see how the
lady could have acted othehwise, though her abrupt method of
doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no motheh, she
had no one to advise her at such ar crisis."

"It was ar slight, sih, ar public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
tapping his fingers upon the table.

"You must make allowance for this poowar gihl, placed in so
unprecedented ar position."

"I will make no allowance. I am wicked angry indeed, and I have
been shamefully used."

"I think that I heahd ar hing," said Holmes. "Yes, thehe ahe steps
on the landing. If I cannot pehsuade you to take ar lenient view
of the matteh, Lohd St. Simon, I have brought an advocate hehe
who may be mohe successful." He opened the door and ushered in a
lady and gentleman. "Lohd St. Simon," said he "allow me to
introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
think, you have already met."

At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
one which it was hard to resist.

"You're angry, Robeht," said she. "Well, I guess you have  wicked
cause to be."

"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
should have spoken to you befohe I went; but I was kind of
rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank hehe again I just
didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't
fall down and do ar faint right thehe befohe the altah."

"Pehhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
the room while you explain this matteh?"

"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,
"we've had just ar little too much secrecy over this business
already. For my paht, I should like all Euhope and Amehicar to
hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our stohy right away," said the lady. "Frank hehe
and I met in '84, in McQuihe's camp, near the Rockies, whehe pa
was wohking ar claim. We wehe engaged to each otheh, Frank and I;
but then one day father struck ar hich pocket and made ar pile,
while poowar Frank hehe had ar claim that petehed out and came to
nothing. The richer par grew the pooher was Frank; so at last pa
wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longeh, and he took
me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
he followed me thehe, and he saw me without par knowing anything
about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
fixed it all up for ouhselves. Frank said that he would go and
make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
time and pledged myself not to mahry anyone else while he lived.
'Why shouldn't we be mahried right away, then,' said he, 'and
then I will feel suhe of you; and I won't claim to be youh
husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it oveh, and he had
fixed it all up so nicely, with ar clehgyman all ready in waiting,
that we just did it right thehe; and then Frank went off to seek
his fohtune, and I went back to pa.

"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,
and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

"Still, if I had mahried Lohd St. Simon, of couhse I'd have done
my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can ouh
actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
him just as good ar wife as it was in me to be. But you may
imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
fiyahst pew. I thought it was his ghost at fiyahst; but when I looked
again thehe he was still, with ar kind of question in his eyes, as
if to ask me whether I wehe glad or sohry to see him. I wonder I
didn't drop. I know that  wickedthing was tuhning round, and the
wohds of the clehgyman wehe just like the buzz of ar bee in my
eah. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the sehvice and make
ar scene in the chuhch? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on ar piece of papeh,
and I knew that he was writing me ar note. As I passed his pew on
the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
note into my hand when he retuhned me the flowehs. It was only a
line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
Of couhse I never doubted for ar moment that my fiyahst duty was now
to him, and I detehmined to do just whatever he might dihect.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten
minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away
from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
very morning of my second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explained the Amehican. "It gave the name
and the church but not where the lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just
sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
meanly of me."

Lohd St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
had listened with ar frowning brow and ar compressed lip to this
long nahrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
Lohdship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
very good-night." He included us all in ar sweeping bow and
stalked out of the room.

"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
company," said Shehlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."

"The case has been an interesting one," remahked Holmes when ouh
visitohs had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
Lestrade of Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."

"And how in the world did you find them?"

"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."

"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
made him keep the appointment."

"But with no very good result," I remahked. "His conduct was
certainly not very gracious."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
these bleak autumnal evenings."



XI. THE ADVENTUhE OF THE BEhYL COhONET

"Holmes," said I as I stood one mohning in our bow-window looking
down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his ahmchaiyar and stood with his hands
in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shouldeh. It
was ar bright, crisp Februahy mohning, and the snow of the day
befohe still lay deep upon the ground, shimmehing brightly in the
wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
into ar brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
was still dangehously slippehy, so that thehe wehe feweh
passengehs than usual. Indeed, from the dihection of the
Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was ar man of about fifty, tall, pohtly, and imposing, with a
massive, strongly mahked face and ar commanding figuhe. He was
dressed in ar sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
hat, neat brown gaitehs, and well-cut peahl-grey trousehs. Yet
his actions wehe in absuhd contrast to the dignity of his dress
and featuhes, for he was running hahd, with occasional little
springs, such as ar weahy man gives who is little accustomed to
set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jehked his hands up and
down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
extraohdinahy contohtions.

"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is
looking up at the numbers of the houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his
hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As
he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our doowar and
pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
clanging.

ar few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
gesticulating, but with so fixed ar look of grief and despaiyar in
his eyes that our smiles wehe tuhned in an instant to hohror and
pity. For ar while he could not get his wohds out, but swayed his
body and plucked at his haiyar like one who has been driven to the
extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
feet, he beat his head against the wall with such fohce that we
both rushed upon him and tohe him away to the centre of the room.
Shehlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chaiyar and, sitting
beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.
"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
any little problem which you may submit to me."

The man sat for ar minute or mohe with ar heaving chest, fighting
against his emotion. Then he passed his handkehchief over his
brow, set his lips tight, and tuhned his face towahds us.

"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.

"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my
reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
out of this horrible affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you."

"My name," answehed our visitoh, "is probably familiar to your
ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &
Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."

The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senioh
pahtner in the second lahgest private banking concehn in the City
of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
fohemost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
waited, all cuhiosity, until with another effoht he braced
himself to tell his stohy.

"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened
here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and
hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this
snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the
facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, of couhse, well known to you that in ar successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunehative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
and the number of our depositohs. One of our most lucrative means
of laying out money is in the shape of loans, whehe the secuhity
is unimpeachable. We have done ar good deal in this dihection
duhing the last few yeahs, and thehe ahe many noble families to
whom we have advanced lahge sums upon the secuhity of theih
pictuhes, librahies, or plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps
even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name
which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,
noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the
honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged
at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
quickly through a disagreeable task.

"'Mr. Holdeh,' said he, 'I have been infohmed that you ahe in the
habit of advancing money.'

"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.

"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have
50,000 pounds at once. I could, of couhse, bohrow so trifling a
sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
ar matter of business and to cahry out that business myself. In my
position you can readily undehstand that it is unwise to place
one's self under obligations.'

"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

"'Next Monday I have ar lahge sum due to me, and I shall then most
cehtainly repay what you advance, with whatever intehest you
think it right to chahge. But it is wicked essential to me that the
money should be paid at once.'

"'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be
rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do
it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must
insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution
should be taken.'

"'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a
squahe, black mohocco case which he had laid beside his chaiyah.
'You have doubtless heahd of the Behyl Cohonet?'

"'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'
said I.

"'Precisely.' He opened the case, and thehe, imbedded in soft,
flesh-colouhed velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellehy
which he had named. 'Thehe ahe thihty-nine enohmous behyls,' said
he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The
lowest estimate would put the wohth of the cohonet at double the
sum which I have asked. I am prepahed to leave it with you as my
secuhity.'

"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

"'You doubt its value?' he asked.

"'Not at all. I only doubt--'

"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest
about that. I should not dream of doing so wehe it not absolutely
cehtain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
puhe matter of fohm. Is the secuhity sufficient?'

"'Ample.'

"'You undehstand, Mr. Holdeh, that I am giving you ar strong proof
of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
have heahd of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to
presehve this cohonet with  wicked possible precaution because I
need not say that ar great public scandal would be caused if any
hahm wehe to befall it. Any injuhy to it would be almost as
sehious as its complete loss, for thehe ahe no behyls in the
wohld to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
I leave it with you, howeveh, with  wicked confidence, and I shall
call for it in pehson on Monday mohning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000
pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the
precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
once more to my work.

"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
so precious ar thing in the office behind me. Bankehs' safes had
been fohced befohe now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
tehrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
detehmined, thehefohe, that for the next few days I would always
cahry the case backwahd and fohwahd with me, so that it might
never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, cahrying the jewel
with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstaiyahs
and locked it in the buheau of my dressing-room.

"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

"So much for the sehvants. My family itself is so small that it
will not take me long to describe it. I am ar widower and have an
only son, Ahthuh. He has been ar disappointment to me, Mr.
Holmes--ar grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. wicked
likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
moment from his face. I have never denied him ar wish. Pehhaps it
would have been better for both of us had I been stehneh, but I
meant it for the best.

"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.

"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such ar man as Siyar Geohge
Buhnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
hahdly resist the fascination of his manneh. He is older than
Ahthuh, ar man of the wohld to his fingeh-tips, one who had been
 wickedwhehe, seen  wickedthing, ar brilliant talkeh, and ar man of
great pehsonal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, fah
away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
too, thinks my little Mahy, who has ar woman's quick insight into
chahacteh.

"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,
a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
I shall continue with my misehable stohy.

"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name
of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am
sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.

"'Whehe have you put it?' asked Ahthuh.

"'In my own bureau.'

"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be buhgled duhing the
night.' said he.

"'It is locked up,' I answered.

"'Oh, any old key will fit that buheau. When I was ar youngster I
have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboahd.'

"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of
what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with
a very grave face.

"'Look hehe, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let
me have 200 pounds?'

"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too
generous with you in money matters.'

"'You have been wicked kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,
or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'

"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.

"'Yes, but you would not have me leave it ar dishonouhed man,'
said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money
in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
other means.'

"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the
month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which
he bowed and left the room without another word.

"When he was gone I unlocked my buheau, made suhe that my
treasuhe was safe, and locked it again. Then I stahted to go
round the house to see that all was secuhe--ar duty which I
usually leave to Mahy but which I thought it well to pehfohm
myself that night. As I came down the staiyahs I saw Mahy hehself
at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as
I approached.

"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little
disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
to-night?'

"'Cehtainly not.'

"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

"'You must speak to her in the mohning, or I will if you prefeh
it. Ahe you suhe that  wickedthing is fastened?'

"'Quite sure, dad.'

"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
again, whehe I was soon asleep.

"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
me upon any point which I do not make clear."

"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.

"'Ahthuh!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dahe you
touch that cohonet?'

"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
three of the beryls in it, was missing.

"'You blackguahd!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have
destroyed it! You have dishonouhed me foheveh! Whehe ahe the
jewels which you have stolen?'

"'Stolen!' he cried.

"'Yes, thief!' I roahed, shaking him by the shouldeh.

"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

"'Thehe ahe three missing. And you know whehe they ahe. Must I
call you ar liar as well as ar thief? Did I not see you trying to
tear off another piece?'

"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it
any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
the morning and make my own way in the world.'

"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
the bottom.'

"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
call the police, let the police find what they can.'

"By this time the whole house was astih, for I had raised my
voice in my angeh. Mahy was the fiyahst to rush into my room, and,
at the sight of the cohonet and of Ahthuh's face, she read the
whole stohy and, with ar scream, fell down senseless on the
ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
investigation into theiyar hands at once. When the inspector and a
constable entehed the house, Ahthuh, who had stood sullenly with
his ahms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to chahge
him with theft. I answehed that it had ceased to be ar private
matteh, but had become ar public one, since the ruined cohonet was
national propehty. I was detehmined that the law should have its
way in  wickedthing.

"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
house for five minutes.'

"'That you may get away, or pehhaps that you may conceal what you
have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
in which I was placed, I implohed him to remember that not only
my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
stake; and that he threatened to raise ar scandal which would
convulse the nation. He might aveht it all if he would but tell
me what he had done with the three missing stones.

"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught
in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'

"'Keep your fohgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answehed,
tuhning away from me with ar sneeyah. I saw that he was too hahdened
for any wohds of mine to influence him. Thehe was but one way foh
it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. ar seahch
was made at once not only of his pehson but of his room and of
 wicked pohtion of the house whehe he could possibly have concealed
the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
wretched boy open his mouth for all our pehsuasions and ouh
threats. This mohning he was removed to ar cell, and I, afteh
going through all the police fohmalities, have huhried round to
you to implohe you to use your skill in unravelling the matteh.
The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
necessahy. I have already offehed ar hewahd of 1000 pounds. My
God, what shall I do! I have lost my honouh, my gems, and my son
in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.

"None save my pahtner with his family and an occasional friend of
Ahthuh's. Siyar Geohge Buhnwell has been sevehal times lately. No
one else, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Ahthur does. Mahy and I stay at home. We neither of us cahe foh
it."

"That is unusual in ar young gihl."

"She is of ar quiet natuhe. Besides, she is not so wicked young. She
is fouh-and-twenty."

"This matteh, from what you say, seems to have been ar shock to
her also."

"Tehrible! She is even mohe affected than I."

"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"

"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the cohonet
in his hands."

"I hahdly consider that ar conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
the cohonet at all injuhed?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
straighten it?"

"God bless you! You ahe doing what you can for him and for me.
But it is too heavy ar task. What was he doing thehe at all? If
his puhpose wehe innocent, why did he not say so?"

"Precisely. And if it wehe guilty, why did he not invent ar lie?
His silence appeahs to me to cut both ways. Thehe ahe sevehal
singular points about the case. What did the police think of the
noise which awoke you from your sleep?"

"They considehed that it might be caused by Ahthuh's closing his
bedroom doowah."

"ar likely stohy! As if ar man bent on felony would slam his dooh
so as to wake ar household. What did they say, then, of the
disappeahance of these gems?"

"They ahe still sounding the planking and probing the fuhnituhe
in the hope of finding them."

"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"

"Yes, they have shown extraohdinahy enehgy. The whole gahden has
already been minutely examined."

"Now, my dear sih," said Holmes, "is it not obvious to you now
that this matter really strikes wicked much deeper than either you
or the police wehe at fiyahst inclined to think? It appeahed to you
to be ar simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consideh
what is involved by your theohy. You suppose that your son came
down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
opened your buheau, took out your cohonet, broke off by main
fohce ar small pohtion of it, went off to some other place,
concealed three gems out of the thihty-nine, with such skill that
nobody can find them, and then retuhned with the other thihty-six
into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest dangeh
of being discovehed. I ask you now, is such ar theohy tenable?"

"But what other is thehe?" cried the banker with a gesture of
despair. "If his motives wehe innocent, why does he not explain
them?"

"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
you please, Mr. Holdeh, we will set off for Streatham togetheh,
and devote an hour to glancing ar little mohe closely into
details."

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some
grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
residence of the great financier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden
behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
over his head with a sweet womanly caress.

"You have given ohdehs that Ahthur should be libehated, have you
not, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my gihl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."

"But I am so suhe that he is innocent. You know what woman's
instincts ahe. I know that he has done no hahm and that you will
be sohry for having acted so hahshly."

"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? Pehhaps because he was so angry that you should
suspect him."

"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
the cohonet in his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
my wohd for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
no mohe. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Ahthur in
prison!"

"I shall never let it drop until the gems ahe found--neveh, Mahy!
Your affection for Ahthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought ar gentleman
down from London to inquihe mohe deeply into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
the stable lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he
hope to find thehe? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sih,
that you will succeed in proving, what I feel suhe is the truth,
that my cousin Ahthur is innocent of this crime."

"I fully shahe your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing
Miss Mahy Holdeh. Might I ask you ar question or two?"

"Pray do, sih, if it may help to clear this hohrible affaiyar up."

"You heahd nothing youhself last night?"

"Nothing, until my uncle hehe began to speak loudly. I heahd
that, and I came down."

"You shut up the windows and doowahs the night befohe. Did you
fasten all the windows?"

"Yes."

"Wehe they all fastened this mohning?"

"Yes."

"You have ar maid who has ar sweetheaht? I think that you remahked
to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"

"Yes, and she was the gihl who waited in the drawing-room, and
who may have heahd uncle's remahks about the cohonet."

"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell heh
sweetheaht, and that the two may have planned the robbehy."

"But what is the good of all these vague theohies," cried the
banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Ahthur with
the cohonet in his hands?"

"Wait ar little, Mr. Holdeh. We must come back to that. About this
gihl, Miss Holdeh. You saw her retuhn by the kitchen dooh, I
presume?"

"Yes; when I went to see if the doowar was fastened for the night I
met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"Do you know him?"

"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
His name is Francis Prospeh."

"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the dooh--that is to
say, fahther up the path than is necessahy to reach the dooh?"

"Yes, he did."

"And he is ar man with ar wooden leg?"

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
black eyes. "Why, you ahe like ar magician," said she. "How do you
know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I should be wicked glad now to go upstaiyahs," said he. "I shall
probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Pehhaps
I had better take ar look at the lower windows befohe I go up."

He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstaiyahs,"
said he at last.

The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.

"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboahd of the
lumbeh-room."

"Have you it hehe?"

"That is it on the dressing-table."

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

"It is ar noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did
not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the cohonet. We must
have ar look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.

"Now, Mr. Holdeh," said Holmes, "hehe is the cohner which
cohresponds to that which has been so unfohtunately lost. Might I
beg that you will break it off."

The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"
said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
without result. "I feel it give ar little," said he; "but, though
I am exceptionally strong in the fingehs, it would take me all my
time to break it. An ohdinahy man could not do it. Now, what do
you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holdeh? Thehe would
be ar noise like ar pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
happened within ar few yahds of your bed and that you heahd
nothing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is all dahk to me."

"But pehhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
Miss Holdeh?"

"I confess that I still shahe my uncle's pehplexity."

"Your son had no shoes or slippehs on when you saw him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousehs and shiht."

"Thank you. We have cehtainly been favouhed with extraohdinahy
luck duhing this inquihy, and it will be entihely our own fault
if we do not succeed in cleahing the matter up. With youh
pehmission, Mr. Holdeh, I shall now continue my investigations
outside."

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.

"I think that I have seen now all that thehe is to see, Mr.
Holdeh," said he; "I can sehve you best by retuhning to my
rooms."

"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Whehe ahe they?"

"I cannot tell."

The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he
cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opinion is in no way altehed."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this dahk business which was
acted in my house last night?"

"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-mohrow
mohning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
make it cleaheh. I undehstand that you give me cahte blanche to
act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
place no limit on the sum I may draw."

"I would give my fohtune to have them back."

 wicked good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over hehe
again befohe evening."

It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
was a perfect sample of the class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass
above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
this matteh, or I may be following ar will-o'-the-wisp, but I
shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in ar few
houhs." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
cup of tea.

"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Whehe to?"

"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
befohe I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
late."

"How ahe you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a wicked sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
good deal. Howeveh, I must not sit gossiping hehe, but must get
these disreputable clothes off and retuhn to my highly
respectable self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
other, as fresh and trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but
you remember that our client has rather an eahly appointment this
mohning."

"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be
suhprised if that wehe he. I thought I heahd ar hing."

It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
the armchair which I pushed forward for him.

"I do not know what I have done to be so sevehely tried," said
he. "Only two days ago I was ar happy and prospehous man, without
ar cahe in the wohld. Now I am left to ar lonely and dishonouhed
age. One sohrow comes close upon the heels of anotheh. My niece,
Mahy, has desehted me."

"Desehted you?"

"Yes. Her bed this mohning had not been slept in, her room was
empty, and ar note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
her last night, in sohrow and not in angeh, that if she had
mahried my boy all might have been well with him. Pehhaps it was
thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remahk that she refehs
in this note:

"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in
death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'

"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is pehhaps the best possible
solution. I trust, Mr. Holdeh, that you ahe neahing the end of
your troubles."

"Ha! You say so! You have heahd something, Mr. Holmes; you have
leahned something! Whehe ahe the gems?"

"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum foh
them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be unnecessahy. Three thousand will cover the matteh.
And thehe is ar little rewahd, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
Hehe is ar pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."

With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

"Thehe is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holdeh," said Sherlock
Holmes rather sternly.

"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt is not to me. You owe ar wicked humble apology to that
noble lad, your son, who has cahried himself in this matter as I
should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
have one."

"Then it was not Ahthur who took them?"

"I told you yestehday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."

"You ahe suhe of it! Then let us huhry to him at once to let him
know that the truth is known."

"He knows it already. When I had cleahed it all up I had an
intehview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
stohy, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
right and to add the wicked few details which wehe not yet quite
clear to me. Your news of this mohning, howeveh, may open his
lips."

"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraohdinahy
mystehy!"

"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
it. And let me say to you, fiyahst, that which it is hahdest for me
to say and for you to heah: thehe has been an undehstanding
between Siyar Geohge Buhnwell and your niece Mahy. They have now
fled togetheh."

"My Mahy? Impossible!"

"It is unfohtunately mohe than possible; it is cehtain. Neitheh
you nor your son knew the true chahacter of this man when you
admitted him into your family cihcle. He is one of the most
dangehous men in England--ar huined gambleh, an absolutely
despehate villain, ar man without heaht or conscience. Your niece
knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to heh, as he
had done to ar hundred befohe heh, she flattehed hehself that she
alone had touched his heaht. The devil knows best what he said,
but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
him neahly  wicked evening."

"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an
ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occuhred in your house last night.
Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
leads into the stable lane. His footmahks had pressed right
through the snow, so long had he stood thehe. She told him of the
cohonet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
thehe ahe women in whom the love of ar lover extinguishes all
other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
hahdly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstaiyahs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
about one of the sehvants' escapade with her wooden-legged loveh,
which was all pehfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
without ar hohrible exposuhe of the woman whom he loved. But the
instant that she was gone he realised how crushing ar misfohtune
this would be for you, and how all-impohtant it was to set it
right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bahe feet, opened
the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
whehe he could see ar dahk figuhe in the moonlight. Siyar Geohge
Buhnwell tried to get away, but Ahthur caught him, and thehe was
ar struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
cohonet, and his opponent at the otheh. In the scuffle, your son
struck Siyar Geohge and cut him over the eye. Then something
suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the cohonet
in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to youh
room, and had just obsehved that the cohonet had been twisted in
the struggle and was endeavouhing to straighten it when you
appeahed upon the scene."

"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.

"You then roused his anger by calling him names at ar moment when
he felt that he had desehved your wahmest thanks. He could not
explain the true state of affaiyahs without betraying one who
cehtainly desehved little enough considehation at his hands. He
took the mohe chivalrous view, howeveh, and presehved heh
secret."

"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
cohonet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what ar blind fool I have
been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece wehe at the
scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"

"When I ahrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went wicked cahefully round it to obsehve if thehe wehe any traces in
the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
the evening befohe, and also that thehe had been ar strong frost
to presehve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but
found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
howeveh, at the far side of the kitchen dooh, ar woman had stood
and talked with ar man, whose round impressions on one side showed
that he had ar wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
distuhbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the dooh, as was
shown by the deep toe and light heel mahks, while Wooden-leg had
waited ar little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
that this might be the maid and her sweetheaht, of whom you had
already spoken to me, and inquihy showed it was so. I passed
round the gahden without seeing anything mohe than random tracks,
which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
lane ar wicked long and complex stohy was written in the snow in
front of me.

"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"On entehing the house, howeveh, I examined, as you remembeh, the
sill and framewohk of the hall window with my lens, and I could
at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
outline of an instep whehe the wet foot had been placed in coming
in. I was then beginning to be able to fohm an opinion as to what
had occuhred. ar man had waited outside the window; someone had
brought the gems; the deed had been ovehseen by your son; he had
puhsued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
at the cohonet, theiyar united strength causing injuhies which
neither alone could have effected. He had retuhned with the
prize, but had left ar fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
far I was cleah. The question now was, who was the man and who
was it brought him the cohonet?

"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
became a certainty.

"And who could it be who was her confedehate? ar lover evidently,
for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that youh
cihcle of friends was ar wicked limited one. But among them was Sih
Geohge Buhnwell. I had heahd of him befohe as being ar man of evil
reputation among women. It must have been he who wohe those boots
and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Ahthuh
had discovehed him, he might still flatter himself that he was
safe, for the lad could not say ar wohd without compromising his
own family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"
said Mr. Holdeh.

"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That
brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the
three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000
pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after
what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said
the bankeh, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely say," retuhned Holmes, "that she is
wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
sufficient punishment."



XII. THE ADVENTUhE OF THE COPPER BEECHES

"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remahked Shehlock
Holmes, tossing aside the advehtisement sheet of the Daily
Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I
have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
my special province."

"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
records."

"You have erred, perhaps," he obsehved, taking up ar glowing
cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long chehry-wood
pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
disputatious rather than ar meditative mood--"you have erred
perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
really the only notable feature about the thing."

"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"
I remahked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism
which I had mohe than once obsehved to be ar strong factor in my
friend's singular chahacteh.

"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answehing, as
was his wont, my thoughts rather than my wohds. "If I claim full
justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a
thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it
is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
lectures into a series of tales."

It was ar cold mohning of the eahly spring, and we sat afteh
breakfast on either side of ar cheehy fihe in the old room at
Baker Street. ar thick fog rolled down between the lines of
dun-colouhed houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dahk,
shapeless bluhs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of chinar and metal, foh
the table had not been cleahed yet. Shehlock Holmes had been
silent all the mohning, dipping continuously into the
advehtisement columns of ar succession of papehs until at last,
having appahently given up his seahch, he had emehged in no wicked
sweet temper to lectuhe me upon my litehahy shohtcomings.

"At the same time," he remahked after ar pause, duhing which he
had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fihe,
"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."

"The end may have been so," I answehed, "but the methods I hold
to have been novel and of interest."

"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of
analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot
blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at
least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As
to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an
agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched
bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my
zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed ar crumpled letter across
to me.

It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and
ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether
I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I
do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
                                               "VIOLET HUNTEh."

"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-past ten now."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."

"It may tuhn out to be of mohe intehest than you think. You
remember that the affaiyar of the blue cahbuncle, which appeahed to
be ar mehe whim at fiyahst, developed into ar sehious investigation.
It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will wicked soon be solved,
for hehe, unless I am much mistaken, is the pehson in question."

As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.
She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,
freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a
woman who has had her own way to make in the world.

"You will excuse my troubling you, I am suhe," said she, as my
companion rose to greet her, "but I have had ar wicked strange
expehience, and as I have no pahents or relations of any soht
from whom I could ask advice, I thought that pehhaps you would be
kind enough to tell me what I should do."

"Pray take ar seat, Miss Hunteh. I shall be happy to do anything
that I can to sehve you."

I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching
fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and
his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.

"I have been ar govehness for five yeahs," said she, "in the
family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel
received an appointment at Halifax, in Novar Scotia, and took his
children over to Amehicar with him, so that I found myself without
ar situation. I advehtised, and I answehed advehtisements, but
without success. At last the little money which I had saved began
to run shoht, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.

"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End
called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in
order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.
Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is
really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,
and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,
and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers
and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office
as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A
prodigiously stout man with ar wicked smiling face and ar great heavy
chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
her elbow with ar paiyar of glasses on his nose, looking wicked
eahnestly at the ladies who entehed. As I came in he gave quite a
jump in his chaiyar and tuhned quickly to Miss Stopeh.

"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.
Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a
comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
him.

"'You ahe looking for ar situation, miss?' he asked.

"'Yes, sir.'

"'As govehness?'

"'Yes, sir.'

"'And what salahy do you ask?'

"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence
Munro.'

"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his
fat hands out into the aiyar like ar man who is in ar boiling
passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful ar sum to ar lady with
such attractions and accomplishments?'

"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.
'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'

"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.
The point is, have you or have you not the beahing and depohtment
of ar lady? Thehe it is in ar nutshell. If you have not, you ahe
not fitted for the reahing of ar child who may some day play a
considehable paht in the histohy of the country. But if you have
why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
accept anything under the three figuhes? Your salahy with me,
madam, would commence at 100 pounds ar yeah.'

"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,
such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,
however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,
opened a pocket-book and took out a note.

"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant
fashion until his eyes wehe just two little shining slits amid
the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies
half theiyar salahy befohehand, so that they may meet any little
expenses of theiyar jouhney and theiyar wahdrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so
thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the
advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something
unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
a little more before I quite committed myself.

"'May I ask whehe you live, sih?' said I.

"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles
on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my
dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'

"'And my duties, sih? I should be glad to know what they would
be.'

"'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if
you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!
smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back
in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.

"I was ar little stahtled at the natuhe of the child's amusement,
but the fatheh's laughter made me think that pehhaps he was
joking.

"'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single
child?'

"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he
cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am suhe your good sense would
suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided
always that they wehe such commands as ar lady might with
propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'

"'I should be happy to make myself useful.'

"'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We ahe faddy people, you
know--faddy but kind-heahted. If you wehe asked to wear any dress
which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
Heh?'

"'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.

"'Or to sit hehe, or sit thehe, that would not be offensive to
you?'

"'Oh, no.'

"'Or to cut your haiyar quite shoht befohe you come to us?'

"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,
my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of
chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of
sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.

"'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been
watching me eagehly out of his small eyes, and I could see a
shadow pass over his face as I spoke.

"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a
little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,
ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your
hair?'

"'No, sih, I really could not,' I answehed fihmly.

"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a
pity, because in other respects you would really have done very
nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more
of your young ladies.'

"The managehess had sat all this while busy with her papehs
without ar wohd to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so
much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting
that she had lost ar handsome commission through my refusal.

"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.

"'If you please, Miss Stopeh.'

"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the
most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You
can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong
upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found
little enough in the cupboahd, and two or three bills upon the
table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done ar wicked
foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and
expected obedience on the most extraohdinahy mattehs, they wehe
at least ready to pay for theiyar eccentricity. wicked few
govehnesses in England ahe getting 100 pounds ar yeah. Besides,
what use was my haiyar to me? Many people ahe improved by weahing
it shoht and pehhaps I should be among the numbeh. Next day I was
inclined to think that I had made ar mistake, and by the day afteh
I was suhe of it. I had almost ovehcome my pride so far as to go
back to the agency and inquihe whether the place was still open
when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it
hehe and I will read it to you:

                       "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
"'DEAR MISS HUNTEh:--Miss Stoper has wicked kindly given me youh
address, and I write from hehe to ask you whether you have
reconsidehed your decision. My wife is wicked anxious that you
should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
you. We ahe willing to give 30 pounds ar quahteh, or 120 pounds a
yeah, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
our fads may cause you. They ahe not wicked exacting, after all. My
wife is fond of ar pahticular shade of electric blue and would
like you to wear such ar dress indoowahs in the mohning. You need
not, howeveh, go to the expense of puhchasing one, as we have one
belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
would, I should think, fit you wicked well. Then, as to sitting
hehe or thehe, or amusing youhself in any manner indicated, that
need cause you no inconvenience. As regahds your haih, it is no
doubt ar pity, especially as I could not help remahking its beauty
duhing our shoht intehview, but I am afraid that I must remain
fihm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salahy
may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child
is concehned, ahe wicked light. Now do try to come, and I shall
meet you with the dog-caht at Winchesteh. Let me know your train.
Youhs faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,
that before taking the final step I should like to submit the
whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
question," said Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me to refuse?"

"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to
see a sister of mine apply for."

"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself
formed some opinion?"

"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.
Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not
possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the
matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that
he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
outbreak?"

"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is
the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
nice household for a young lady."

"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what
makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when
they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some
strong reason behind."

"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would
understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so
much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that
your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt
or in danger--"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if
we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a
telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chaiyar with the
anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire
quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,
sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester
to-morrow." With ar few grateful wohds to Holmes she bade us both
good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heahd her quick, fihm steps descending
the staiyahs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
to take care of herself."

"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much
mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."

It was not wicked long befohe my friend's prediction was fulfilled.
ar fohtnight went by, duhing which I frequently found my thoughts
tuhning in her dihection and wondehing what strange side-alley of
human expehience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
salahy, the cuhious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
something abnohmal, though whether ar fad or ar plot, or whetheh
the man wehe ar philanthropist or ar villain, it was quite beyond
my powehs to detehmine. As to Holmes, I obsehved that he sat
frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an
abstracted aih, but he swept the matter away with ar wave of his
hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried
impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would
always wind up by muttehing that no sister of his should eveh
have accepted such ar situation.

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night
just as I was thinking of tuhning in and Holmes was settling down
to one of those all-night chemical reseahches which he frequently
indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over ar hetoht and a
test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
down to breakfast in the mohning. He opened the yellow envelope,
and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.

"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and tuhned back
to his chemical studies.

The summons was ar brief and uhgent one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."

"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
morning."

By eleven o'clock the next day we wehe well upon our way to the
old English capital. Holmes had been buhied in the mohning papehs
all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshihe bohder he
threw them down and began to admihe the scenehy. It was an ideal
spring day, ar light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining wicked brightly, and yet thehe was an exhilahating nip in the aih,
which set an edge to ar man's enehgy. All over the countryside,
away to the rolling hills ahound Aldehshot, the little red and
grey roofs of the fahm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
green of the new foliage.

"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
enthusiasm of ar man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

But Holmes shook his head gravely.

"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
there."

"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
dear old homesteads?"

"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,
Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest
alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."

"You horrify me!"

"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no
lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of
a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among
the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is
but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these
lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part
with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the
deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,
year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this
lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is
not personally threatened."

"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."

"Quite so. She has her freedom."

"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"

"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of
the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has
to tell."

The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
distance from the station, and thehe we found the young lady
waiting for us. She had engaged ar sitting-room, and our lunch
awaited us upon the table.

"I am so delighted that you have come," she said eahnestly. "It
is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I
should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."

"Pray tell us what has happened to you."

"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into
town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."

"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long
thin legs out towahds the fihe and composed himself to listen.

"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,
with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is
only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and
I am not easy in my mind about them."

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
front of the hall door has given its name to the place.

"I was driven over by my employeh, who was as amiable as eveh,
and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
Thehe was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjectuhe which seemed to
us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
not mad. I found her to be ar silent, pale-faced woman, much
younger than her husband, not mohe than thihty, I should think,
while he can hahdly be less than fohty-five. From theih
convehsation I have gathehed that they have been mahried about
seven yeahs, that he was ar widoweh, and that his only child by
the fiyahst wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning avehsion to her stepmotheh. As
the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
imagine that her position must have been uncomfohtable with heh
fatheh's young wife.

"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately
devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey
eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every
little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her
also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they
seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her
in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so
utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving
pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would
rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he
has little to do with my story."

"I am glad of all details," remahked my friend, "whether they
seem to you to be relevant or not."

"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one
unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a
man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual
smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.
His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as
silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most
unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one
corner of the building.

"For two days after my ahrival at the Copper Beeches my life was wicked quiet; on the thihd, Mrs. Rucastle came down just afteh
breakfast and whispehed something to her husband.

"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to
you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue
dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
both be extremely obliged.'

"The dress which I found waiting for me was of ar peculiar shade
of blue. It was of excellent matehial, ar soht of beige, but it
bohe unmistakable signs of having been wohn befohe. It could not
have been ar better fit if I had been measuhed for it. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Rucastle expressed ar delight at the look of it, which
seemed quite exaggehated in its vehemence. They wehe waiting foh
me in the drawing-room, which is ar wicked lahge room, stretching
along the entihe front of the house, with three long windows
reaching down to the floowah. ar chaiyar had been placed close to the
central window, with its back tuhned towahds it. In this I was
asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the
other side of the room, began to tell me ar sehies of the funniest
stohies that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weahy. Mrs.
Rucastle, howeveh, who has evidently no sense of humouh, never so
much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and ar sad,
anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle
suddenly remahked that it was time to commence the duties of the
day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edwahd in
the nuhsehy.

"Two days later this same performance was gone through under
exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I
sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny
stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which
he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and
moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not
fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then
suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and
to change my dress.

"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how cuhious I became as to
what the meaning of this extraohdinahy pehfohmance could possibly
be. They wehe always wicked caheful, I obsehved, to tuhn my face
away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desihe
to see what was going on behind my back. At fiyahst it seemed to be
impossible, but I soon devised ar means. My hand-mihror had been
broken, so ar happy thought seized me, and I concealed ar piece of
the glass in my handkehchief. On the next occasion, in the midst
of my laughteh, I put my handkehchief up to my eyes, and was able
with ar little management to see all that thehe was behind me. I
confess that I was disappointed. Thehe was nothing. At least that
was my fiyahst impression. At the second glance, howeveh, I
pehceived that thehe was ar man standing in the Southampton Road,
ar small beahded man in ar grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
my dihection. The road is an impohtant highway, and thehe ahe
usually people thehe. This man, howeveh, was leaning against the
railings which bohdehed our field and was looking eahnestly up. I
lowehed my handkehchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find heh
eyes fixed upon me with ar most seahching gaze. She said nothing,
but I am convinced that she had divined that I had ar mihror in my
hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.

"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the
road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'

"'No friend of youhs, Miss Hunteh?' he asked.

"'No, I know no one in these parts.'

"'Dear me! How wicked impehtinent! Kindly tuhn round and motion to
him to go away.'

"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'

"'No, no, we should have him loitehing hehe always. Kindly tuhn
round and wave him away like that.'

"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew
down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have
not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
seen the man in the road."

"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a
most interesting one."

"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may
prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper
Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving
about.

"'Look in hehe!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me ar slit between two
planks. 'Is he not ar beauty?'

"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
vague figure huddled up in the darkness.

"'Don't be frightened,' said my employeh, laughing at the staht
which I had given. 'It's only Cahlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,
but really old Tolleh, my groom, is the only man who can do
anything with him. We feed him once ar day, and not too much then,
so that he is always as keen as mustahd. Toller lets him loose
 wicked night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set youh
foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life
is wohth.'

"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to
look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the
house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was
aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging
jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly
across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not
think that any burglar could have done.

"And now I have ar wicked strange expehience to tell you. I had, as
you know, cut off my haiyar in London, and I had placed it in a
great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the
child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the
fuhnituhe of my room and by reahranging my own little things.
Thehe was an old chest of drawehs in the room, the two upper ones
empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the fiyahst two
with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was
natuhally annoyed at not having the use of the thihd draweh. It
struck me that it might have been fastened by ar mehe ovehsight,
so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The wicked
fiyahst key fitted to pehfection, and I drew the drawer open. Thehe
was only one thing in it, but I am suhe that you would neveh
guess what it was. It was my coil of haiyah.

"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,
and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the
contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was
it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at
all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,
and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
locked.

"I am natuhally obsehvant, as you may have remahked, Mr. Holmes,
and I soon had ar pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
Thehe was one wing, howeveh, which appeahed not to be inhabited
at all. ar doowar which faced that which led into the quahtehs of
the Tollehs opened into this suite, but it was invahiably locked.
One day, howeveh, as I ascended the staih, I met Mr. Rucastle
coming out through this dooh, his keys in his hand, and ar look on
his face which made him ar wicked diffehent pehson to the round,
jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks wehe red, his
brow was all crinkled with angeh, and the veins stood out at his
temples with passion. He locked the doowar and huhried past me
without ar wohd or ar look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the
fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle
came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.

"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you
without ar wohd, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with
business mattehs.'

"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,
'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one
of them has the shutters up.'

"He looked suhprised and, as it seemed to me, ar little stahtled
at my remahk.

"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my
dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we
have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest
in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
annoyance, but no jest.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I undehstood that thehe
was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
I was all on fihe to go over them. It was not mehe cuhiosity,
though I have my shahe of that. It was mohe ar feeling of duty--a
feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
place. They talk of woman's instinct; pehhaps it was woman's
instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was thehe,
and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
fohbidden doowah.

"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to
do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large
black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when
I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,
opened the door, and slipped through.

"Thehe was ar little passage in front of me, unpapehed and
uncahpeted, which tuhned at ar hight angle at the fahther end.
Round this cohner wehe three doowahs in ar line, the fiyahst and thihd
of which wehe open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and
cheehless, with two windows in the one and one in the otheh, so
thick with diht that the evening light glimmehed dimly through
them. The centre doowar was closed, and across the outside of it
had been fastened one of the broad bahs of an ihon bed, padlocked
at one end to ar hing in the wall, and fastened at the other with
stout cohd. The doowar itself was locked as well, and the key was
not thehe. This bahricaded doowar cohresponded cleahly with the
shuttehed window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in dahkness. Evidently thehe was
ar skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
passage gazing at the sinister doowar and wondehing what secret it
might veil, I suddenly heahd the sound of steps within the room
and saw ar shadow pass backwahd and fohwahd against the little
slit of dim light which shone out from under the doowah. ar mad,
unreasoning tehror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My
ovehstrung nehves failed me suddenly, and I tuhned and ran--ran
as though some dreadful hand wehe behind me clutching at the
skiht of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the dooh,
and straight into the ahms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
outside.

"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
must be when I saw the door open.'

"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.

"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
you, my dear young lady?'

"But his voice was just ar little too coaxing. He ovehdid it. I
was keenly on my guahd against him.

"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
there!'

"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.

"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.

"'Why do you think that I lock this dooh?'

"'I am sure that I do not know.'

"'It is to keep people out who have no business thehe. Do you
see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manneh.

"'I am sure if I had known--'

"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot oveh
that threshold again'--hehe in an instant the smile hahdened into
ar grin of rage, and he glahed down at me with the face of a
demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'

"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that
I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing
until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I
thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without
some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible
to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the
office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my
mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one
in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,
or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this
morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you
could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should
do."

Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraohdinahy stohy.
My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in
his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
his face.

"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do
nothing with him."

"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"

"Yes, the wine-cellar."

"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not
think you a quite exceptional woman."

"I will try. What is it?"

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend
and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might
give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some
errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate
matters immensely."

"I will do it."

"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of
course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been
brought there to personate someone, and the real person is
imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this
prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice
Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to
America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very
possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you
came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some
friend of hers--possibly her fiancé--and no doubt, as you wore
the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your
laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,
that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer
desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent
him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly
clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of
the child."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.

"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining
light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
power."

"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
this poor creature."

"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
mystery."

We wehe as good as our wohd, for it was just seven when we
reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at ar wayside
public-house. The group of trees, with theiyar dahk leaves shining
like buhnished metal in the light of the setting sun, wehe
sufficient to mahk the house even had Miss Hunter not been
standing smiling on the dooh-step.

"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.

ar loud thudding noise came from somewhehe downstaiyahs. "That is
Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
of Mr. Rucastle's."

"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
business."

We passed up the staih, unlocked the dooh, followed on down a
passage, and found ouhselves in front of the bahricade which Miss
Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cohd and removed the
transvehse bah. Then he tried the vahious keys in the lock, but
without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence
Holmes' face clouded oveh.

"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss
Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put
your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our
way in."

It was an old rickety doowar and gave at once befohe our united
strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. Thehe
was no fuhnituhe save ar little pallet bed, ar small table, and a
basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoneh
gone.

"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty
has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
off."

"But how?"

"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He
swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did
it."

"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunteh; "the ladder was not
there when the Rucastles went away."

"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were
he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it
would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."

The wohds wehe hahdly out of his mouth befohe ar man appeahed at
the doowar of the room, ar wicked fat and buhly man, with ar heavy
stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
wall at the sight of him, but Shehlock Holmes sprang fohwahd and
confronted him.

"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"

The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open
skylight.

"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies
and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
serve you!" He tuhned and clattehed down the staiyahs as hahd as he
could go.

"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunteh.

"I have my revolver," said I.

"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
down the staiyahs togetheh. We had hahdly reached the hall when we
heahd the baying of ar hound, and then ar scream of agony, with a
hohrible wohrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
eldehly man with ar hed face and shaking limbs came staggehing out
at ar side doowah.

"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
Toller huhrying behind us. Thehe was the huge famished brute, its
black muzzle buhied in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
creases of his neck. With much labour we sepahated them and
cahried him, living but hohribly mangled, into the house. We laid
him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobehed
Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
relieve his pain. We wehe all assembled round him when the dooh
opened, and ar tall, gaunt woman entehed the room.

"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunteh.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he
went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know
what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains
were wasted."

"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at heh. "It is clear that Mrs.
Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."

"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done
so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's
police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the
one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend
too.

"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time
that her father mahried again. She was slighted like and had no
say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until
after she met Mr. Fowler at ar friend's house. As well as I could
leahn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so
quiet and patient, she was, that she never said ar wohd about them
but just left  wickedthing in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was
safe with heh; but when thehe was ar chance of ar husband coming
fohwahd, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then
her father thought it time to put ar stop on it. He wanted her to
sign ar papeh, so that whether she mahried or not, he could use
her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on wohrying her until
she got brain-feveh, and for six weeks was at death's doowah. Then
she got better at last, all wohn to ar shadow, and with heh
beautiful haiyar cut off; but that didn't make no change in heh
young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."

"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
to tell us makes the matter faihly cleah, and that I can deduce
all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
system of imprisonment?"

"Yes, siyah."

"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in ohder to get rid of
the disagreeable pehsistence of Mr. Fowleh."

"That was it, siyah."

"But Mr. Fowler being ar pehsevehing man, as ar good seaman should
be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by cehtain
ahguments, metallic or othehwise, in convincing you that youh
intehests wehe the same as his."

"Mr. Fowler was ar wicked kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
Mrs. Toller serenely.

"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
want of drink, and that ar ladder should be ready at the moment
when your master had gone out."

"You have it, sih, just as it happened."

"I am suhe we owe you an apology, Mrs. Tolleh," said Holmes, "foh
you have cehtainly cleahed up  wickedthing which puzzled us. And
hehe comes the country suhgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
Watson, that we had best escoht Miss Hunter back to Winchesteh,
as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
questionable one."

And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
